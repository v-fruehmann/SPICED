Legoland,3.7,Indoor playground,"Potsdamer Str. 4, 10785 Berlin, Germany",legolanddiscoverycentre.com,My son loved it. It is a place to visit with kids and actually I also liked it,"It was pricey but worth the money to spend half a day here. Just make sure you pack food and drinks, as there is only one restaurant and they do not have proper food. They only have snacks and those are also pricey.","You
Can easily spend the entire day here. It has many attractions for the little ones including 4d cinema! Small food corner to buy some basics but certainly amazing environment. You should not miss it!","Complete waste of money. The Berlin lego world is a little interesting, but that's it.

The entrance is strange. You but tickets online but have to stand in a queue with those that haven't got tickets, even though you have to specify a time online what's the point??!!

The cafe doesn't open until 11:30! We got here at 10:15... do they not want to make money? Oh that's right,  they make it from the horrific ticket prices.

My son is 9, seems happy.  If you're asking me, stay home, play your kids instead, because it's essentially that

Don't bother","Not worth the money. Lego is leveraging its name. Poor and small exhibition, overcrowded with no sanitization of Lego bricks, large carousels again not working, dirty toilets .... the list goes on. Save the money. There are many many more places for kids available in Berlin to spend your money on. Many other and better indoor playgrounds available. Actually, if I would be CEO of Lego, this whole center would be under marketing expenses booked and may be charged at cost to consumers. Total rip off. Cannot recommend at all.","Complete waste of time and money - a huge disappointment! Miniland is beautiful and impressive with many fine details, but otherwise there's nothing to look forward to. At the entrance we bought photo passes and activity books. Photo passes gave access to just one photo and one video, and the activity books didn't match the actual conditions. Several pages in the books were not found in the centre. It seemed like some places in the centre had been changed, but they still sell old books, so as an example the children can't collect all the stamps in the book. Don't buy it!

In the laser maze in Ninjago City, you can't see several of the lasers, Merlin's Apprentice was closed, and you can continue like that. It was really disappointing and I don't get why Lego put their name on this place. We've also been to Legoland Discovery Centre in Birmingham, and it's much better and can't be compared to the one in Berlin. Fortunately I had warned our children that when you've been to Legoland in Billund, Legoland Discovery Centre is a disappointment, but the word ""disappointment"" doesn't cover here at all. It was really bad and doesn't even deserve one star!"

The theme is saving natural environment and educate kids all about nature using toys and many hands-on activities. We had a great 3 hours visit. Plenty of stations to build, explore, learn, paint, etc. there is a outdoor area with tricycle and other toys. My kid enjoyed a lot and had a hard time leaving this place. Staff very kind and friendly. I am glad i found this for my kid.","A wonderful place for children to play, touch, explore and learn in a fun way. My children of 2, 7 and 10 years old loved it. It's absolutely worth the visit even if you come from the other side of town. I guess it depends what you are used to, in France sadly there is nothing that cool for children, so we were amazed. Also we met a friendly lady who works there and speaks 6 languages including French. I recommend +++. It's so cosy, my two year old didn't want to leave and wanted to sleep there.","Well thought out, hands on, play and exploration for kids up to 10 or 11 years old. My 5yo and 10yo played for hours and did not want to leave.
Little coffee shop inside serving coffee and bakery items made it a wonderful experience for theirs mom, too.","Super small poorly done indoor playground. If kids are 2-3 years old, they might find some fluffy toys to olay with. Otherwise it's a waste of money.","Costed 28 Euros( 3 adults and 1 child ) for 1.5 hours of minimal activity.
There were 5 - 6 games outside. The guides didn't care to explain or indulge in the activities. They kind of seems upset with something. Really sad faces.
The games were fine ( Coloring, sorting weights, Questionare, Magnets, Hidden Toys and books ). Total disappointment !!

One of the games were to teach the importance of insects and how to save our ecosystem, and in the end when we were leaving, they were offering dried dead insects to people as snacks ( telling its a good source of protein )","paid 19‚Ç¨ just for 1.5hrs summer program , totally worthless. wont even consider going thr again."

My little one had a blast. The staff is very friendly, which is quite rare for Berlin. Great experience!","Very nice place, it is not a museum as one would expect, but there are many activities for kids to do like different sections for different crafts. Theres also a maze in which the kids can climb up, a small mirror maze and lots and lots of kids books.

The kids had so much fun. I would recommend this place.","Fun for the kids! Lots of staff to help out with  painting, button making and printing. And I don't think I've ever seen a place more Berlin then this :) Everything is second hand, re-used and everything in the cafe is organic. And there is beer!","Don't waste your money and time at the MachMit, there was only one person assisting the children (an older lady who did not connect with them at all and was bossing everyone). The tables at the cafe were exclusively for customers, which meant they were empty the whole time while we had to eat out lunch in a damp, dirty basement!! Personnel were utterly unfriendly and the only one thing that looked interesting (a printing station) was closed, of course no one told us of this detail at the time of paying ‚Ç¨21 for 3 unhappy visitors!! Visit the Kinder Museum instead, which is great and less pretentious!! There was also an empty half boat and a poor shomaker's shop. Awful.",Rip off. Kids and adults pay the same. 2 adults + 1 kid. 21 euro! And then you have to buy your own drinks or food. Ok for kids not amazing. A total rip off!,Update your opening hours. Your advertising and listed as open. It‚Äôs NOT open today or until the 1.1.2020
Little BIG City Berlin,4.2,Museum,"Panoramastra√üe 1a, 10178 Berlin, Germany",littlebigcityberlin.de,"even if a dwarf puts on huge boots, it's still a dwarf.  And so it's no wonder that this tour of Berlin's gloomy and deprived past seems entertaining.  From the founding of the city in 1237 to the fall of the Wall, it takes about an hour and a half if you also read the information boards.  the museum presents itself modern and tidy thanks to the innovative lighting.  The cheapest tickets are available via Groupon for ‚Ç¨10 per person.","Loved the experience and highly recommend. Light instalation and interactive motion activated features were exciting. Berlin tourist card paid off immediately,  just saying.",I am a first grade teacher and I took my class of 25 students there. The museum was laid out in a great way for my students to walk and explore on their own. I felt that it was a great place to take children from grades 1-6 because there is enough to see and stimulate learning as well as advanced information for older learners. The staff was very helpful as they took our jackets and lunches and kept them safe and out of the way while we explored and even helped us with their first aid kid when one student got an ‚Äúowey.‚Äù I highly recommend this museum. I may go back myself!,"One of the most boring attractions I have ever been to üòÖüôÑ

Adding audio guide would have been a plus

Don't go if you don't enjoy German humor or don't want to learn about city of berlin history

The small statues looked nice yet the place was very dispointing to me",Very expensive and not all suitable for young kids. The little interaction there is so quiet you can‚Äôt hear due to the other background noise.  Think it is very expensive for what is just some small models and a bit of video. If you have kids don‚Äôt bother with this attraction.,"Please DON'T waste your money on this one!!! There's just one room and the different, way-too-loud noises from various corners (including sound of bombs) is hard to bear. NOT suitable for children unless you enjoy your children torture a prisoner since the exposition is sooo interactive... it's terribly superficial, what a sham to pretend people can learn something about history here. My child felt like they're taking the piss when the ""reward"" for discovering miniature princesses was a couple of vouchers! Oh, we were so disappointed with that one room. But the worst was yet to come - they announce that after the history part, there's a room showing ""modern Berlin"". And what do you get see there?! ONE model of the Brandenburg Gate! One building of modern Berlin, that's all! Plus some silly illuminations and the digital guide's saying ""good-bye"" in 6 languages. What a sad trap."

2.something‚Ç¨ for Adults as entrance and 6.something‚Ç¨ for a day ticket for children, atleast clean the playground and do some dusting, I wouldn't like my child to inhale all those and get allergy.

The size of the indoor playground could have been great, location is also great but everything else were on the poor side.","The place is not good at all for small toddlers like 2 years old...there are not many play options for them and you have to stay for one hour or then it's a day ticket, nothing in between....also you have to pay for carousel ride and car bumper rides...not good value for money"

There is plenty of space to sit and relax so make sure to bring some food with you.","One of the must visit museum in Berlin.
It's very famous museum in Berlin.
1 day will be enough for seeing whole museum.
Museum hosts details about technology used in all the aspects of the life.
There are so many small experiments you can perform in the museum which helps you understand the technology.
You can see the earliest stages of computer which are very huge and occupy size of big room.","This place is like Disneyland for all those who like science and technology,  and even for those who doesn't it's a great place to learn how to like it. From the first computers, to the evolution of airplanes and trains, there's so much to see it that it can that more than one day if you wish to see it all of it.

The place is so amazing that's worth visiting just for the view of the outside area where you can even have a picnic!

Great for kids ans adults likewise and quite cheap for all that it has to offer. My favorite museum in Berlin (I have visited it 3 times already).

It's fairly accessible by train or subway and there's a good restaurant and caf√© inside.",The explainers walked away from us. One suggested for the kids to read texts instead of showing how to use an exhibit. The place is old and not suitable for young kids.,"Caf√© only sells glass bottled water which are closable for 5 euro, and tells you you Can drink it in the museum. Then the museum staff tells you you can only drink the water in special areas because it is a glass bottle. What an absolute joke of an establishment.","Highly disappointed.

The space for the sea life is limited and in most cases not shielded from the visitors. Nobody from staff is controlling the guests. It results with kids interfering with open tanks, hitting/knocking the glass tanks, screaming aloud. In addition, the place is not looking like the photos present. It is confined, small, cheap, and build to provide the low level quality for the sea life and visitors. Strongly advised to not support.","Super bad, nothing to see just empty aquarium, if you go to Pairi Daiza, KL sea world, Dubai Aqua World or Orlando‚Äòd sea world, a huge disappointment.

A lot of texts and very old exhibits.,That's museum is just for children. Too boring for adult.,"Sadly we were unable to visit as they wouldn't allow us to take a very small shoulder bag in with us. The staff said to put our rucksack in the locker, which is common and we were happy to do, but then would not allow my partner in with his small shoulder bag which contains his medicines. They said if we didn't put it in a locker we could put his things in a plastic bag that they would give us - this isn't really acceptable, and they gave no explanation for this policy. We had no problem taking his tiny bag around the Technikmuseum next door and had a great time there. I was looking forward to seeing Spectrum afterwards, it's frustrating that they have such bizarre policy on bags and no information displayed about this.

That‚Äôs how great the Tierpark is!,"The place offers some relaxed walking around nature with lots of animals to see. You can visit the rabbit's area and the petting zoo. Be careful as the animals at the petting zoo are a bit aggressive; especially the goats, and they might kick you, so be careful when you bring small kids.","I think it's one of the coolest animal park in Berlin. It's pretty big and you can spend good amount of time in walks or rest around.

The number of animals are lesser than Berlin Zoo but here you have different areas which compensate for that.

Himalayas was my favourite as you get to climb up and get some good walk up hill.

Overall it's recommended !!","Waste of time and money, took my kid there and he was disappointed because he couldn't see most of the animals he wanted to see like,lion,giraffe bear etc
All the animals there are animals you can see in a free entrance zoo.
The other bigger zoo in the city is better","When you‚Äôre from hamburg this zoo is really bad, the aquarium too. The animals don‚Äôt have that much space and its hard to find anything here.

First the door man was very unfriendly and did not great or even make any eye contact .

I was very disappointed on how the garden was looked after and not sure why the steep price for entrance just to see dead plants and a badly looked after place .

I got to the green house and I was refused entrance 15min before closing . The one staff member just throw there cigarette on the floor in front of use . I hope they picked it up after we left .

I had a great meal at the restaurant and the owner was very helpful and happy. I do recommend a beer or meal there .

Be prepared for the unexpected when visiting . I‚Äôm sure the green house is amazing.
Please note you need to pay a second fee to enter there also.
So one ticket to walk to the green house and a second to enter.","You pay 6 Euro for the entrance, and what you see here is only constructions and dead plants","DO NOT GO during corona times, it's a SCAMM.
They are selling tickets only online for something you can't see, because all the greenhouse are closed and the gardens outside are all under construction. So you pay a ticket to enter and have acc√©s to the Cafe inside. That's it."

The museum itself though is beautiful, with some brilliant exhibitions. It doesn‚Äôt take too long to go around but there are lots of things to see. The fossils and dinosaurs were very intriguing and the taxidermy section was brilliant to bring across the science aspect of evolution.

No mention of the rules whatsoever on the museum website, my family is disappointed and we‚Äôre traveling back home with a wasted day. Very careless behavior from the museum towards their visitors and children.","Unfortunately our visit to the museum was ruined by a very unfriendly employee. I had sat down with my two year old daughter on a bench (where there were no signs that we could not eat or drink) and gave her a slice of apple. I was then approached and told my daughter had to sit in the buggy to eat and that we weren‚Äôt in a restaurant but a museum. After asking why my daughter had to sit in the buggy, there was no reason given and the woman walked off.
Apart from that rude encounter, the exhibitions were rather bare and it felt like little energy in invested in making a visit exciting.
Won‚Äôt be going again or recommending to others.","Booking is only available three days in advance, the problem is that is not clear or contradictory which days are open or not (they simply don¬¥t say clearly) so you keep checking and then the tickets never appear. Booked my holiday around the visit and now I have no tickets. A total waste of time and money!!"

Bambooland Berlin Spandau,3.5,Indoor playground,"Nonnendammallee 117, 13629 Berlin, Germany",bambooland.de,Nice but small place. Location is really good since you can go shopping,Our kids love this place so so so so so so much. No exageration on the so. The place is clean my kids always get the fun they need and we happy to take them there. Kuddos to all the team!,A very nice place. Me and my little neighbour from 3 yrs having a really nice time here. It's Sunday morning and not to busy and crowded at the moment. Favorite place is the trampoline. I think I will not be able to get her homeüòÇüòÖüòÅ Danke 's sch√∂n Bambooland Spandau.,"My daughter had a great time, but we won't be coming back. In short, I found it unsafe, uncomfortable, and extremely loud. I got hurt and my child was out of my sight much of the time. It's not good for families with mixed age kids.

First, I think the owners should consider that the parents pay for the entrance, so perhaps it makes sense to consider our comfort on even a basic level. There are no places to sit downstairs. Adults squat on tiny cushions, even though there is a huge open space near the entrance where some comfortable chairs or tables could easily fit. There are tables and chairs upstairs but you can't watch your child downstairs while they play. That's just not okay for me. I had to squat in a corner on the floor while I breastfed my baby. It was terribly uncomfortable.

The climbing area downstairs is dark and the play equipment is so crowded that you cannot keep track of your child at all. If you have to watch a smaller child or baby, forget about watching a bigger one. They are gone. I lost my daughter the majority of the time.

And forget about calling for your child or hearing them if they get hurt or lost and call for you.  It is painfully loud. I have been to several nice indoor playgrounds. I know they are loud, but this place has made no attempt at all to damper the noise. It's like being at a rock concert but it's just screaming children. Absolute hell.

Also, I hurt myself. When we arrived, I was told that adults are encouraged to join in on the equipment. I went down a slide after my daughter, and the landing was so hard that one week later, I still have significant pain in my tailbone and lower back. I can hardly sit. I am not much larger than an average preteen boy, for referrence. I landed really hard on a concrete floor that is covered with hardly an inch of padding.

I also have to echo what others said about the smelly, dirty bathrooms.

And if you have a baby, you had better bring a baby carrier. Strollers/buggies are not allowed in.

If you just have older children and you're deaf, you'll have a great time. For me, it was not nice at all. I briefly had fun chasing my daughter around on the equipment, but then I got hurt.

Also, why is the small child/baby area upstairs?! People with babies often have older children as well who also need supervision...but they are playing downstairs where you can't see or hear them.

Oh, and the stairs are a death trap. I was terrified walking down holding my baby while children ran up and down and around us. One bump and things could have been catastrophic. I honestly don't know how this place is in business. Someone will get seriously hurt if they don't fix anything.","They made me pay double. My son and me: 1 day card for kid + 1 for me + Zeitkarte for kid ?? Why the kid should pay a day card plus a time card? We were there for less then 3 hours.
And this time it was also very dirty. Never again.","dark, dirty and quite expensive. Definitely not worth it!"

Wonderful gift shop and even more wonderful staff. I cannot recommend this fascinating museum highly enough! We will be back next time we are in Berlin.,"What an amazing place to visit!
If you're interested in computer games at all, this is THE place to go. They have loads of exhibits on the history and evolution of entertainment technology, as well as lots of actual consoles you can play, and even a gaming arcade!
It can get a bit busy, which makes it harder to get a turn at any of the machines, but it's absolute heaven for gaming enthusiasts, especially if you're nostalgic for older games and gaming consoles!","Simply put : wonderful.

A cozy, chill place where I learned a LOT about my favorite pass time even though I‚Äôd consider myself pretty well versed. It‚Äôs so cool to see all the love and care that went into it. You can really feel the attention to detail from the presentation to the way you can interact with the exhibition.

A must visit if you like the medium ‚ù§Ô∏è","It's all about reading, not much to play and the arcade area was very busy.","Very disappointing, they say it's 60 years of gaming history, but they mainly focus on the 70's, 80's and early 90's. The last 20 years of the gaming world isn't represented at all, how the entire industry have grown and effected the world is not shown. The information they show was underwhelming and not presented in a interesting way, and so was the interactions, which was limited to a few arcade games. All in all, the place is small and not worth the money, I regret spending my money and time there, I do not understand how it got so many high ratings, but it's definitely not worth a visit",Somehow Berlin managed to make a museum for videogames boring. Germans aren't good at crafting experiences and this museum is an excellent example.

Our 2,5 yrs old daughter hat such a fun day ü•≥","Omg the entrance fee is pricey but so much to do, it‚Äôs totally worth it. Budget extra to pay for some rides and food. There is a sign that says all non EC cards are accepted for purchases above 100 euro. However I was told only EC cards are accepted period. To be safe remember to bring cash if you don‚Äôt have an EC card. If you forget your cash you can find an ‚Äúatm‚Äú at hotel  ‚ÄúOtel‚Äú close by or the Springful S Bahn stop. No outside food allowed. You can buy inside and portions are generous and not pricey. My suggestion bring a container to put up some of the food, so your child can have multiple helpings throughout the day. Otherwise you will need to buy food twice or something if you are there for many hours. Socks must be worn to play. There are play options for the tiniest toddler to the biggest kid even adults. If you are using public transportation bring a flashlight if you will stay late and have a little one who is afraid of the dark. The place is in an remote industrial looking area that is very dark at night and appears spooky to a small child. All in all nice enough place for a birthdays or to reward a child or just to be somewhere a bit nicer than normal.","The employee On the cashier was very aggressive and she was unfriendly, then she talked to other people who are (local) in very nice way!!!
I would never take my kids to such a place.","was there on a cloudy day so it was quite dark inside. Asked the lady at the counter 3 times to turn on the lights. The last time I asked her, she said her boss told her not to turn it on as its still bright. I asked her what her boss' name is and she rudely said ""why?"". I told her as a customer i want to know. Extremely rude, dark (saving on electric bill after making so much money is unacceptable) and also quite cold. Shame on management for being such cheap a$$e$!!!

Edit: The manager Hr. Dudensohn did come to our table. Wow...now I understand why the workers are so rude here....when the manager/owner here is so rude and basically tells me ""if u dont like it here, then dont come again"", then how should the people under him treat customers.

Overall a fun experience for a date or for the family, as long as you're not too scared of everything","Definitely recommend this fun experience!!
We (tourists, couple) arrived too late for our show, but the staff was so friendly to help us out with rescheduling for free. You can tell they have your best interest in mind to give you a good time.
Also one of the staff members called me Princess a couple of times so that adds to the 5 star review as well of course!
As for the show experience itself, it's not too scary apart from the few dark moments, it's rather a fun time with all the actors including you in their show. Shows are 3 times a day and you have a German as  well as an English option. We did the English one, everything was clear and easy to follow.","The overall experience was great. Imagine going to a theater to see a show, but now you find yourself as a cast member participating. It was truly a fun experience full of laughter, suspense, and excitement!

Everything about it, from booking the time, to getting the kids into the trampoline area, to the actual celebration, was easy and stress free. I booked the time slot five days in advance without any problems (I don't suggest putting it off that long). They were flexible about who was jumping (one kid couldn't make it, so they allowed an adult to go instead), they were flexible on the start time (people were late and all the kids need to go in at the same time), and the staff was friendly and very helpful throughout. I definitely recommend this place for birthday parties. Also, highly recommended just for the fun of it. They have courses, for both kids and adults, a foam block pit that is too much fun and even a trapeze. Definitely worth going.","This place is fun and great value for money. The kids loved it!

The coffee shop has A LOT of potential¬†and it is well equipped¬†for the babies and moms/families visiting. It is a great place and very well located. I hope the owners of this place take some time to do some customer service improvements. After my last experience I will not be coming back not would I recommend this place due to the lack of tolerance and respect from the girl working in the cafe during the¬†day.

It is very unfortunate that the girl who works there is just not friendly at all nor has compassion and manners to deal with the customers. She lacks customer service and friendliness that is needed in a place like this. I went there last Thursday with three other moms and unfortunately, we lasted about 3 min before walking¬†out and leaving, she was rude and seemed to be having a bad day. In the end, when we left, she went outside to sit down on the outside bench to be on her phone. So even if she had other tasks, she wasn't working on them.

From leaving the baby wagons outside to asking us not to remove the face masks at all and let's add the rudeness of her attitude!¬† Here are my recommendations for the owner in specific of what we dealt with:

1- Add a handrail to be able to lock the baby wagons outside
2- You could even make some money if you rent locks for 1-3‚Ç¨ for those who come without one
3- We know rules have changed during this time of COVID, in suggest printing them and having it on the¬†wall/window for customers to see/read
4- Change your staff working to someone who is kid-friendly and is willing to go the extra mile for people coming to your coffee shop.

During this time of uncertainty, we have all learned to be more compassionate and friendly in general. Moms/Parents are already struggling and it is just a terrible treatment to come to your coffee shop and feel unwelcome. From the other reviews, it seems that we aren't the only ones with the same opinion.

If the staff changes please let us know so we can make an effort to come back to your place!"

Madame Tussauds Berlin,4.3,Wax museum,"Unter den Linden 74, 10117 Berlin, Germany",madametussauds.com,"This museum is absolutely outstanding! I never expected it to be that big and have that good quality wax figures! It was as if I could meet famous people and my favorite movie characters in real life! All the figures are so realistic, it's crazy. I really loved that all the exhibits were sorted by themes, like German celebrities, world famous football players, scientists and musicians, pop singers etc. Each figure was surrounded by cool and creative decorations that were really conductive for taking amazing pics! The price might appear quite big, but it's definitely worth it! And you can also get student or children discounts:).","Interesting experience.I have never been in such museum before so I definetely recommend to visit one, even if in different city.

Part with actors is too small And some of them are not very similar to real people (at least less similar with the same actors but in films), but some are very good.You can take free pic of one statue near entrance.",I believe place. The sculptures are so realistic and so interesting. I paid ‚Ç¨ 28 for 2 student tickets. People yous need to visit this place it‚Äôs incredible!! Would defo recommend.

Which I think should be adjusted in the price! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",Overrated. Short. Full of fools taking photos of themselves with lumps of wax. A true tourist rip off at over ‚Ç¨20 per person. We felt less ripped off as it was included with the welcome card. There are plenty of incredible things to see in Berlin. Give this one a miss.,The costumer service was very bad. Multiple people got to cut in line in front of us because ‚Äúwe had more time‚Äù (to wait) they did not prioritize their walk-in costumers.... and very very unprofessional.... I do not recommend it... but if you really want to see a bunch of wax figures go for it.....
Zeiss Major Planetarium,4.6,Planetarium,"Prenzlauer Allee 80, 10405 Berlin, Germany",planetarium.berlin,"The place is really cool and the staff is engaged and super helpful. You can get some snacks and drinks out of an Automat for fair prices.

We watched the new Voyager show and it was really informative. Can only recommend it. Also for Kids.","Great place for families! Tickets for adults 9.5 Eur, with reduction 7.5 Eur, for smaller kids for free. Shows delivered in DE or ENG language.",Went for a free concert for the Fete de la Musik festival. The planetarium has great quality in what is projected. Really likes the experience of live musik and vivid visuals.,"The ""English"" show was not actually in English. Half of it was told in German. There's a short video that you can get a physical translator for. They made us go get it during the show. Having walked downstairs the workers told me I was too late because the show had already started. The person behind me during the show complained about the light coming from the translator device.
Having most of the show be in German, it left early","We have checked the program with the right date and time;arrived half an hour prior to the performance time,the receptionist asked us to wait for five minutes away as there is no available couple places and she will check and solve it to us
After waiting for give minutes,we went back for her , surprising sold all other people the tickets and inform us that the tickets are sold

We are forigieners came from another country and that's what we have received! Informality and unprofessionalism and even after informing her that she was the reason
She replied sorry but no solutions ,do whatever you want

The historic significance of this place and all the little details that they‚Äôve added made it a really cool experience. Also make sure to checkout the museum gift shop, best souvenir gift shop I‚Äôve seen in a long time","This has to be one of my favorite historical places in Berlin for me.

The reason is that it conveys the message of that cold war era Berlin where we had divisions and how things have improved for good now.

It gives me hope that if people get united then we can definitely break all the borders and u it together as a single nation comprising of different race, ethnicities and religions.

This is a must visit especially during the day so you can capture better pictures üì∏","I enjoyed my time here, as we passed by this landmark during my walking tour. I would recommend to go on a tour or at least have some knowledge/context on what took place and why this landmark is important. I think without the context, it would be less enjoyable.
However, there is a mini gallery/timeline outside across the street with the history of the Berlin Wall to visit if you need more information as well as a paid museum.","Was in Berlin last week and thought of visiting checkpoint Charlie. Beware of a group of 4 to 6, some identified in the photo trying to trick and scam money out of unsuspecting tourists with their ""box shuffle"" game. Their plot was very persuasive and crafty. At first I was not interested or even paid any attention to their commotion. I was standing under the pole with the picture of the Russian soldier taking this picture. Then they, (faces circled in picture) asked me to join, which I declined with a hand gesture. Then the guy with the walking stick approached me and just handed a hundred Euro to my hand, while ushering me to join. Then they all in one unison was 'bombarding' me to chip in some money. It was muddling to me with everyone saying things like 'its jackpot', 'come on' all at once. Foolishly I gave them some money and now they all persuaded me to pick the boxes. I tried to get out at this stage but realized it was already too late. The guy the walking stick even prevent me stepping back with his stick. I delayed picking the boxes to the point where the game dealer has to lift the board to my face at which I have no choice but pick a box.  When I asked for my money, they said you lost. Just sharing the story so that others can be warned and avoid my foolish mistake. This people make an otherwise decent tourist spot into a bad experience. You can see in the picture the lady putting money inside her purse. This was before I got scammed, so I don't know how many unsuspecting tourists got tricked of their money that day. May you reap what you sow.","There is one photo I uploaded that sums up this iconic landmark - ""Checkpoint Cheesy"" displayed in McDonald's.

The place is nothing more than a tacky tourist spot. There is a small museum on site that explains its significance, but that is the only redeeming feature.",Waste of time and money. Guys wearing Ray bands in non period uniforms. 6 euro for a pic. The real history and significance is lost. The East Berlin border is gone. The tension and atmosphere is distracted by tourists running in and out of passing cars to get a fake picture. Really don't bother.
Magic Mountain (Climbing / Bouldering),4.6,Rock climbing gym,"B√∂ttgerstra√üe 20, 13357 Berlin, Germany",magicmountain.de,Great climbing space! Very competent staff and awesome routes. Definitely a lot cleaner than other climbing gyms I've seen so far.,"Lovely and best indoor/outdoor climbing gym in Berlin. Good selection of both indoor and outdoor walls, and a small nice shop & cafe. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Had our English language lead climbing courses here, which were great!","Very big and well equipped place. The staff is nice and helpful. In addition to the climbing and bouldering areas, they have a small gym for doing strength and cardio, a sauna, a steam room. Showers, toilets and lockers are available (but bring your soaps).","(Translated by Google) The Hall is still a nice climbing experience, for everyone who likes climbing. When I wanted to climb again with a colleague after a long break, the receptionist wasn't convinced that I still mastered the safety technique (despite showing my top rope certificate). I was immediately recommended to attend a new course for 150 euros. But when I was able to demonstrate in practice that everything was still in control, the topic was reluctantly off the table. Then my climbing harness was criticized for being so old. The belt is less than 10 years old and in good condition. So no chance of a sale here either. But eventually my belay device was judged to be unfit and no longer legal and allegedly there have been many accidents involving this type of belay. Can't confirm, I climbed with it for a few years without any problems. But now you had an approach to make money. I was forbidden to climb with the device, I first have to receive training in the new device in the form of a trainer hour for 80 euros per person and then I would also need a new device. From the point of view of the employees, there was no other possibility. And with that, I let myself drip off. My colleague and I were then at least allowed to boulder. Registering in the system via QR code did not work either and had to be entered manually. After bouldering we wanted to spend some time in the sauna, but unfortunately that didn't go smoothly either, as the sauna had to be heated up first.
My conclusion about Magic Mountain: if you are not willing to constantly invest a lot of money in trainer lessons or the equipment offered, you are not a welcome guest. A solution with the belay device might have been, I buy the new device in the hall and get a briefing from the house as a service. From my point of view, that would have been a win-win solution, but then the earnings would not have been as high.
It's a shame Magic Mountain, I don't think I'll be back, even if you're the only hall that size.

(Original)
Die Hallist nach wie vor ein sch√∂nes Klettererlebnis, f√ºr alle die gerne Kletter. Als ich letztens wieder mit einem Kollegen nach doch l√§ngerer Pause klettern wollte war man am Empfang nicht davon √ºberzeugt, dass ich die Sicherungstechnik noch beherrschen (trotz Vorlage meines Top Rope Scheines). Man hat mir gleich empfohlen, f√ºr 150 Euro, einen neuen Kurs zu besuchen. Als ich aber praktisch vorf√ºhren konnte, dass alles noch beherrsche, war das Thema widerwillig vom Tisch. Dann wurde an meinem Klettergurt bem√§ngelt, er w√§re schon so alt. Dabei ist der Gurt keine 10 Jahre alt und im guten Pflegezustand. Auch hier also keine Chance auf Verkauf. Aber schlie√ülich wurde mein Sicherungsger√§t als untauglich und nicht mehr zul√§ssig bewertet und angeblich gab es schon viele Unf√§lle mit dieser Art der Sicherung. Kann ich nicht best√§tigen, ich bin einige Jahre damit geklettert ohne Probleme.  Aber nun hatte man einen Ansatz um Geld zu machen. Mir wurde verboten mit dem Ger√§t zu klettern, ich m√ºssen zun√§chst eine Beschulung mit dem neuen Ger√§t erhalten und das in Form einer Trainerstunde f√ºr 80 Euro pro Person und dann br√§uchte ich ja auch noch ein neues Ger√§t. Eine andere M√∂glichkeit g√§be aus Sicht der Angestellten nicht. Und damit lie√ü sich mich dann auch Abtropfen. Mein Kollege und ich durften dann wenigstens noch bouldern. Das Registrieren im System via QR Code klappte dann auch nicht und musste langwierig manuell eingeben werde. Nach dem bouldern wollten wir dann noch etwas in der Sauna verbringen, auch das lief leider nicht reibungslos, da die Sauna erst noch angeheizt werden musste.
Mein Fazit zu Magic Mountain: wenn man nicht bereit ist st√§ndig viel Geld zu investieren in Trainerstunden oder angebotenes Equipment ist man kein gern gesehener Gast. Eine L√∂sung mit dem Sicherungsger√§t w√§re vielleicht auch gewesen, ich kaufe das neue Ger√§t in der Halle und bekomme eine Einweisung vom Haus als Service. Das w√§re aus meiner Sicht eine Win Win L√∂sung gewesen,  tja aber dann w√§re der Verdienst nicht so hoch gewesen.
Schade Magic Mountain, ich glaube ich komme nicht wieder, auch wenn ihr die einzige Halle in der Gr√∂√üe seid.","(Translated by Google) A bit exhausting staff, very expensive to rent equipment, card payment only from 10‚Ç¨ ridiculous in the 21st century for the size of the company.

It was quite hard, and has a little twist in comparison to other rooms. Realy recommended.","(Translated by Google) We played Bloodlust today and like some of our forerunners, unfortunately I have to agree.
The escape room isn't really a horror escape and many of the effects (a door didn't open at all where the main clue was, another door that shouldn't be open, technology didn't work) didn't work.
We actually had all the solutions, but we didn't make any progress. The game was interrupted several times and then heavily jammed doors were opened.
In itself, the story behind the escape may be meant to be nice, but the implementation is very lacking.
Fun and horror gave way to frustration and disappointment.
Pity Unfortunately.

Wir spielten heute Bloodlust und wie einige unserer Vorspieler muss ich mich leider anschlie√üen.
Der Escaperoom ist nicht wirklich ein Horrorescape und es haben viele Effekte (eine T√ºr ging gar nicht auf, wo der Haupthinweis drin war, eine andere T√ºr war bereits auf die nicht offen sein sollte, Technik funktionierte nicht)nicht gegriffen.

At the beginning of the game there was a briefing from a less motivated employee who appeared to be unwilling to join our group. After the briefing, we were sent into the room. This was consistently disappointing. The clues were all very obvious, so we had actually solved the puzzle within 20 minutes. There were no surprise effects. Rather, the room resembled a short occupational therapy, which clearly lacked attention to detail! I am definitely not a Room Escape professional, but even for me, who only participated in such a game for the second time, the instructions to solve the puzzle were far too easy! Paying 25 euros for it was really disappointing and unfortunately a complete waste of money to be more or less ""fun"" for 35 minutes. When asked whether there were more interesting, larger and more difficult rooms, the answer was only evasive. The employee probably just wanted to enjoy the end of her working day.

Leider bin ich total entt√§uscht von meinem Erlebnis bei Mission Accepted. Zu Beginn des Spiels gab es eine Einweisung von einer wenig motivierten Mitarbeiterin, die den Anschein machte, keine Lust auf unsere Gruppe zu haben. Nach der Einweisung wurden wir in den Raum geschickt. Dieser war durchweg entt√§uschend. Die Hinweise waren alle sehr offensichtlich, sodass wir eigentlich binnen 20 Minuten schon das R√§tsel gel√∂st hatten. Es gab keine √úberraschungseffekte. Vielmehr √§hnelte der Raum einer kurzen Besch√§ftigungstherapie, der deutlich die Liebe ins Detail fehlte! Ich bin definitiv kein Room Escape Profi, aber selbst f√ºr mich, die erst das zweite Mal an so einem Spiel teilnahm, waren die Hinweise zur L√∂sung des R√§tsels viel zu einfach! Daf√ºr 25 Euro gezahlt zu haben, war wirklich entt√§uschend und leider eine komplette Geldverschwendung, um 35 Minuten mehr oder weniger ""bespa√üt"" zu werden. Auf die Frage, ob es denn auch interessantere, gr√∂√üere und schwierigere R√§ume gebe, wurde nur ausweichend geantwortet. Wahrscheinlich wollte die Mitarbeiterin einfach ihren Feierabend genie√üen. Das war f√ºr mich auf jeden Fall der letzte Besuch bei Mission Accepted!","(Translated by Google) As a team of four friends, we have already experienced three great escape rooms at other providers and unfortunately have to say: this one (""Space Escape"") was by far the worst.
With all the others it was about freeing oneself through tricks, teamwork, various tunnels and imaginatively furnished spaces.
In ""Space Escape"" there is only one room (which you can also leave during the game) with a carelessly tinkered ""spaceship center"". In the course of the game it is only a matter of pressing any buttons and lights on the basis of cryptic messages. The actual game happening is followed on a large screen, which is just plain boring - especially if you don't get a step further for a full quarter of an hour at the beginning and the game master still doesn't give you a tip.
One step in the game was also broken, so the game master had to come into the room and intervene - that doesn't exactly create tension either. And that for a pretty steep price. You just feel ripped off.
We're guaranteed not to come here again.
EDIT - to your answer: Stupid excuse. Of course, ALL Escape Rooms have to be equipped with emergency exits, which is already prescribed by the building police. Nevertheless, they have to give the illusion that one is ""locked in"" there and that one must ""free"" oneself. It's part of the game! In the good escape rooms that we already had, you even had to ""fight"" your way through several rooms one after the other. And that is not the case with you. Her ""Escape Room"" is a single room and technology crammed with an unimaginative paper mache backdrop, colorful lights, buttons and levers that didn't even work properly, so that several times an employee had to come in and intervene. Sorry, but that was really under control you know. Never again (no other game from you either)!

(Original)
Als Team von vier Freunden haben wir schon drei tolle Escape-Rooms bei anderen Anbietern erlebt und m√ºssen leider sagen: der hier (""Space Escape"") war mit Abstand der schlechteste.
Bei allen anderen ging es darum, sich durch Tricks, Teamwork, diverse Tunnel und phantasievoll ausgestattete Zwischenr√§ume zu befreien.
Bei ""Space Escape"" gibt es nur einen Raum (den man zudem w√§hrend des Spiels verlassen kann), mit einer lieblos zusammengebastelten ""Raumschiff-Zentrale"". Im Spielverlauf geht es einzig darum, auf der Basis kryptischer Botschaften irgendwelche Kn√∂pfchen und L√§mpchen zu dr√ºcken. Das eigentliche Spielgeschehen verfolgt man auf einem gro√üen Bildschirm, was einfach nur langweilig ist - vor allem wenn man gleich zu Anfang eine geschlagene Viertelstunde lang erkennbar nicht einen Schritt weiterkommt und die Spielleiterin trotzdem keinen Tipp gibt.
Ein Spielschritt war au√üerdem auch noch kaputt, sodass die Spielleiterin in den Raum reinkommen und eingreifen musste - auch das ist nicht grade spannungsf√∂rdernd. Und das f√ºr einen doch ziemlich happigen Preis. Da f√ºhlt man sich einfach nur √ºber den Tisch gezogen.
Hier kommen wir garantiert nicht nochmal her.
EDIT - auf Ihre Antwort: Bl√∂de Ausrede. Nat√ºrlich m√ºssen ALLE Escape Rooms grunds√§tzlich mit Notausg√§ngen ausgestattet sein, das schreibt schon die Baupolizei vor. Trotzdem m√ºssen sie die Illusion vermitteln, dass man dort ""eingeschlossen"" ist und sich ""befreien"" muss. Das ist Teil des Spiels! In den guten Escape Rooms, die wir schon hatten, musste man sich sogar nacheinander durch mehrere R√§ume ""k√§mpfen"". Und das ist bei Ihnen nun so gar nicht der Fall. Ihr ""Escape Room"" ist ein einziger, mit phantasieloser Pappmach√©kulisse vollgestopfter Raum und Technik, bunten L√§mpchen, Kn√∂pfchen und Hebelchen, die dann noch nicht mal richtig funktioniert haben, sodass mehrmals eine Mitarbeiterin reinkommen und eingreifen musste.

Berlin Wall Memorial,4.6,Memorial park,"Bernauer Str. 111, 13355 Berlin, Germany",berliner-mauer-gedenkstaette.de,Words cannot express the feeling that overwhelmed me while visiting this memorial. Make sure you have plenty of time to explore and read the riveting stories. This was by far 1 of my most epic places I've visited,"So much history here. While the wall is no longer there, some original parts were, and there were several signs with pictures and historical information on them to explain the wall. I love history, but even those who don‚Äôt can appreciate this. The signs are easy to follow, clearly written, and even tell interesting stories about certain people. Highly recommend visiting this spot if you go to Berlin.","An interesting place to walk around. Remnants of the wall, there are areas marked out where old pavements were, the lights used to illuminate the wall to.
The wall of photos etched on glass was poignant as it put faces to people who died trying to get over the wall.

A place worth making an effort to visit","It is nice to be there but when you start to read about the misarable stories, then you feel terrible","Experiencing one of history's great landmarks is truly awesome.  So why 1 star?  Because of the memorial's content.  Instead of focusing on the wall itself, the division it caused, the cold war, the Allies, or anything else, the dominating central focus is on the Nazi rise to power.  The rise is depected, as I have tried to evidence w my cheap camera, in a mostly neutral/positive light.  Several pics of crowds cheering Hitler can be seen, but the suffering he caused is limited to brief and tiny letters; no pics.  You might say the book burning is a negative photo, but if u can read the caption even that seems legit; they were honoring a man killed by communists!  The designers who chose to depict the Nazis this way should be questioned by proper authority, and the content of this memoral changed to accurately reflect the history of this Cold War icon.  I hope the other Berlin Wall Memorial locations already do.",Theres nothing but a plaque.
Lasergame Berlin GmbH,4.7,Laser tag center,"Nordhauser Stra√üe, √ñffnung nur nach Buchung, im Hof 26, 10589 Berlin, Germany",spielt-lasertag.de,"We made a booking online and they replied very quickly, we also modified it twice and everything went smoothly. Finally, we had a team event yesterday and had a great time! The whole staff is very friendly and always very willing to help. For all of us it was the first time we did Lasertag and we were very happy, we laughed a lot! It was a lot of fun! I highly recommend bringing a change shirt as they suggest on their website. I recommend it and would definitely do it again. Thank you very much for all the organization and for the nice time!","Don't forget to bring a Clothes change
It was pretty funny, we had the birthday pack, played for 1,5h multiple games with multiple outcomes so everyone could ""win"" based on the skills. Afterwards we were so tired that everyone went home though the plans were others
Definitely recommend and kudos to the staff that was really helpful and friendly",Just fun. Big room. Good for large groups. We went there for a lasartag company event,"I booked my son's birthday there and 3 weeks later, I still feel furious and humiliated about the staff rudeness. As I wasn't a player but just there to watch the kids, I didn't understand that I also needed to do a covid test. Even though I'm fully vaccinated with booster (and ok to wear the mask), I was denied access and had to stay outside as, according the young lady, ""the rule is the rule"". Fine...Suddenly, a young man goes out and tells me that ""I'm allowed to quickly come in to pay"". I guess the rule isn't the rule after all. As I was ready to stay outside for one hour (duration of game), a gamer got hurt, an ambulance had to be called and games postponed. To conclude, I had to wait outside for 2 hours outside and NO ONE ever proposed a chair or even a glass of water or hot drink. It's been a very long time I haven't felt treated in such a rude manner. I know that unfortunately businesses in Berlin have no clue how costumer service is, but that one was something.",Already closed,"(Translated by Google) I wanted to refrain, but with these answers from the owner, I would like to share my experience.

I belong to the group that did not receive an email with the payment request.
Our organizer contacted the team because she didn't get a confirmation of our booking. In response, our sent emails were appended with a single sentence stating that these two requests were received. In these inquiries, a date selection was made by us. From our point of view, there was nothing more to do, because the mail apparently arrived. This was followed at some point by a second message on the day of our booking. The organizer has not yet been reached by phone or email and whether we want to play today or not because we have not paid a deposit. Confusing for us. We didn't know there was a payment request. That's why an email was written at all and asked whether our date selection had been sent. In the end we were allowed to come and pay cash there.
We arrived with a smaller part of the group. The employee was friendly and then asked us for the tests, which we didn't know about. Our whole group is fully vaccinated and is in any case in favor of adhering to Corona regulations if there are any. The reaction of the employee was annoying after she knew from which group and booking we came. Her way of dealing with us changed and she said something like oh my boss already told me everything and that she could show us her server email history. I made it clear that we didn't know anything about this because the payment request email (which was supposed to contain the info) didn't arrive. I'm not interested in what technology it was. To my comment ‚ÄúWe understand about the tests. It would only have been nice if we had simply been made aware of this, because the email with the information didn't arrive.‚Äù the only reaction was incomprehension. To be fair, you can find this info on their website by scrolling way down the main page (on mobile). However, we landed directly on the laser tag page via the search engine and did not search the entire site (UI/UX design could be improved).

In summary: I played laser tag here a few years ago. Everything was okay then. With the current booking, however, the contact was rude and, in my opinion, unprofessional. When I read some reactions to criticism in the ratings here, it confirms my picture and I don't want to support it like that. The difference is, when things are going smoothly, there may be fewer problems. But if something tiny goes wrong here, then you encounter a lack of understanding and arrogance. Everyone has to decide for themselves whether they want to support it.

Ich wollte mich zur√ºckhalten, aber bei diesen Antworten des Inhabers, m√∂chte ich meine Erfahrung nun doch teilen.

Ich geh√∂re zu der Gruppe, die keine Email mit der Zahlungsaufforderung erhalten hat.
Unsere Organisatorin hatte das Team kontaktiert, weil sie keine Best√§tigung f√ºr unsere Buchung bekommen hat. Als Antwort wurden unsere gesendeten Emails angehangen mit einem einzigen Satz, der aussagte, dass man diese zwei Anfragen erhalten hat. In diesen Anfragen wurde eine Terminauswahl von uns getroffen. Aus unserer Sicht war dann nichts mehr zu tun, denn die Mail kam anscheinend an. Daraufhin folgte irgendwann eine zweite Nachricht am Tag unserer Buchung. Man hat die Organisatorin per Telefon und Mail bisher nicht erreicht und ob wir heute nun spielen wollen oder nicht, weil wir keine Anzahlung geleistet haben. F√ºr uns verwirrend. Wir wussten nicht, dass es eine Zahlungsaufforderung gab. Deswegen wurde √ºberhaupt eine Mail geschrieben und gefragt, ob unsere Terminauswahl gesendet wurde. Letztendlich durften wir kommen und dort bar zahlen.
Mit einem kleineren Teil der Gruppe kamen wir an. Die Mitarbeiterin war freundlich und bat uns dann um die Tests, von denen wir nichts wussten. Unsere ganze Gruppe ist vollst√§ndig geimpft und ist jedenfalls daf√ºr, wenn es Corona Regelungen gibt, dass man sich daran h√§lt. √Ñrgerlich war die Reaktion der Mitarbeiterin, nachdem sie wusste von welcher Gruppe und Buchung wir kamen. Ihr Umgang mit uns √§nderte sich und sie sagte etwas wie ach, mein Chef hat mir schon alles gesagt und dass sie uns ihren Serveremailverlauf zeigen k√∂nnte. Ich stellte klar, dass wir nichts davon wussten, weil die Zahlungsaufforderungsmail (welche die Info beinhalten sollte) nicht ankam. Mir geht es keineswegs darum, an welcher Technik es gehangen hat. Auf meine Anmerkung ‚ÄûWir verstehen das mit den Tests. Es w√§re nur sch√∂n gewesen, h√§tte man uns einfach darauf aufmerksam gemacht, weil die Mail mit den Infos nicht ankam.‚Äú hat man nur mit Unverst√§ndnis reagiert. Fairerweise findet man diese Info auf deren Website, wenn man auf der Hauptseite weit nach unten scrollt (am Handy). Wir sind √ºber die Suchmaschine jedoch direkt auf der Lasertag-Seite gelandet und haben nicht die ganze Website durchsucht (UI/UX Design k√∂nnte verbessert werden).

Zusammengefasst: Ich habe vor einigen Jahren hier Lasertag gespielt. Damals war alles okay. Bei der aktuellen Buchung hingegen war man im Kontakt unh√∂flich und meiner Meinung nach unprofessionell. Wenn ich hier einige Reaktionen auf Kritik in den Bewertungen lese, best√§tigt das mein Bild und so m√∂chte ich es nicht unterst√ºtzen. Der Unterschied ist, wenn alles glatt l√§uft, gibt es evtl. weniger Probleme. Wenn hier aber etwas klitzekleines schief l√§uft, dann trifft man auf Unverst√§ndnis und Arroganz. Da muss jeder selbst √ºberlegen, ob man das supporten will."

Do yourself a favour and stay away from this place!","(Translated by Google) Unfortunately, I have to rate this facility with only one star. Unfortunately, price and performance no longer match. We paid over 53 euros for 4 people. Including disposable 3D glasses that you know from the cereal box.

The staff that day was really nice and accommodating.

However, the lanes are very worn and the tees and lanes are mostly repaired with tape. So much tape that you keep getting stuck with the bat. Ceilings and walls are very dusty. The ventilation is not particularly good. All in all, the entire area is really very carelessly and listlessly designed. I really wonder where all the money that's being made here goes. It definitely doesn't go into the facility.

This was our second visit hoping things have improved. Unfortunately this was not the case. Only the photos you may have taken for social media are great. Just don't use flash.

It's really a shame because we had a relatively long way to go. It wasn't fun. We will not go down this path again.

Leider muss ich diese Anlage mit nur einem Stern bewerten. Preis und Leistung stimmen leider nicht mehr √ºberein. Wir haben f√ºr 4 Personen √ºber 53 Euro gezahlt. Inklusive Einweg 3D-Brillen die man aus der Cornflakespackung kennt.

Das Personal an diesem Tag war wirklich nett und zuvorkommend.

Die Bahnen jedoch sind sehr stark abgenutzt und die Abschlagpunkte und Bahnen meist mit Klebeband repariert. So viel Klebeband das man dauernd mit dem Schl√§ger h√§ngen bleibt. Decken und W√§nde sind sehr stark verstaubt. Die L√ºftung ist nicht besonders gut. Alles in allem ist die gesamte Anlage wirklich sehr lieblos und lustlos gestaltet. Ich frage mich wirklich wo das ganze Geld hingeht das hier eingenommen wird. In die Anlage geht es definitiv nicht.

Es war unser zweiter Besuch in der Hoffnung das sich etwas verbessert hat. Dies war leider nicht der Fall. Lediglich die Fotos die man eventuell f√ºr soziale Medien gemacht hat sind super. Man darf nur keinen Blitz verwenden.

Wirklich sehr schade da wir doch einen relativ langen Weg hatten. Spa√ü hat es keinen gemacht.

I can buy cans in any store, but very rarely fresh produce. The rustic farmhouse where Life Wurst was cooked is the way to go. Around 3pm on Sunday some stalls were packing up as there was nothing left or something to sell. The full price for a sausage was collected even if the rolls were missing. The last, sometimes unsightly, pieces of cake should no longer be laid out. The employee who charged four (4) euros for the parking lot at around 2:45 p.m. was the one who really enjoyed his job. Perhaps at the time while the stalls are packing up, parking fees should be reduced. At about 4 p.m. he was already gone and that was right! Overall no mood. The children's playground was the best.

Wir waren erstmalig zum sogenannten Schlachtefest und waren entt√§uscht. B√ºchsen kann ich in jedem Gesch√§ft kaufen, aber Frischewaren sehr selten. Der rustikale Bauernstand, in dem Life Wurst gekocht wurde, ist der richtige Weg. Gegen 1500 Uhr am Sonntag packten einige St√§nde ein, da nichts mehr vorhanden war oder einiges zum Verkaufen nicht mehr da war. Der volle Preis bei einer Wurst wurde auch bei fehlendem Br√∂tchen kassiert. Letzte zum Teil unansehnliche Kuchenst√ºcken sollte man nicht mehr auslegen. Der Mitarbeiter, welcher vier (4) Euro f√ºr den Parkplatz gegen 1445 Uhr kassierte, war derjenige, dem seine Arbeit richtig Spa√ü machte. Vielleicht sollte man zu der Zeit, w√§hrend die St√§nde einpacken, die Parkgeb√ºhren senken. Um ca 1600 Uhr war er dann bereits weg und das war richtig so! Insgesamt keine Stimmung.

The performers only had less than 100 people who wanted to dance. According to the person in charge, no seating could be folded out, although the majority of the guests who had traveled were of retirement age. For older people it is an impertinence to stand for 5 hours.
Due to a lack of advertising for this event, very few people came. From the artistic side there was nothing to complain about.

At reception we were already told to be lenient as they were understaffed. Apparently they were just the two of them. Then there was a short and concise introduction regarding the seat belt. Unfortunately, I wasn't quite finished and had problems with the helmet. Both coaches were then out of sight again. And at first I was alone with my problem. After a few minutes, a trainer came back and then helped me. As a result, we were late for the introductory video and missed a part. Then there was a short briefing on how the carabiners work and then it should start... First of all we stood there helplessly and didn't know how, what, where to go... We looked in vain for a trainer. We definitely needed a trainer! At some point we tried unsuccessfully to move through the course, in the end we were only able to overcome one obstacle.

I can understand anyone wishing to close up in time, I really do, but if the amount of time permitted isn't enough, then either DON'T SELL tickets that late or TELL visitors it's not smart to book at that time. if I'd known, I definitely would've gotten tickets for a different day and time slot.","I expected to see a ‚ÄúGerman‚Äù spy museum. It is a spy museum. Any thing you may see in any other country. The games are cool but it has no significant aspect that would worth the time.

So engaging, and every detail is carefully designed and deeply evocative. I would skip the Berlin Wall Museum and come here instead.","Fantastically designed museum that captures the history of the Jewish population across the times in Germany.

The installations are very modern and detailed. You can expect to learn about the complete history of Jews in Germany from Jews of the Worms all the way to the present day.

The building itself is spectacularly designed to reflect Jewish history in Germany. There is also plenty of information about the design of the building so that people (like me who can't comprehend design concepts) can fully appreciate all the work that went into its construction.

The temporary exhibits are also worth catching!!",Amazing museum. The building itself is an experience. The concept behind his architecture blew my mind. The core exhibition is free and well worth the walk and time spent. A must visit for any museum lover.,A load of nothing....very strange waste of effort....lots of concrete though. The Jewish memorial in the city is the same...very odd,The total experience was really poor! The first and second floor were closed. The exhibition in the underground floor consisted of a few spare images. Actually this building is interesting only for its architecture..,"Probably the worst museum I have ever visited. It's not about Jews and the war. It's mostly just about the history of Jews. Even so, the exhibition is very poor with only a few exhibits of no interest and some spaces that are supposed to make visitors feel like the Jews during war, but with complete failure. Costs 8 euros to get in and they make you leave your coat, bag, and everything you carry in the entrance for no obvious reason."

I was a bit skeptical about 75 euros for 2 min flight. Ok the whole experience takes almost 2 hours but the rest of that 2 min is training, preparing and lots of waiting. Just 2 min flight?
It was definitely a blast!
First of all we all learnt that a min can take way longer than 60sec :)
Staff can speak English too but what tops everything is their attitude. All smiles, super friendly and great with kids and teenagers.

Easy to access with car, no parking space problem, there is a small bar for some drinks (where also the flying person has 1 drink free card), they are taking photos in the tunnel and sending them afterwards via email. Also if you are around, you can come.and watch people in the tunnel as well.
If there was an option of like an annual subscription or something which makes financially a good offer, we would definitely sign up.","Amazing place, full of extremely positive energy and happy people! ü§ü Flying experience is definitely a must-try for everyone!","I really enjoyed the 3 minutes flight today with Lukas and the briefing was excellent. The team was really nice to me. I‚Äôd like to thank the Ceo, Lukas, Lisa, Sebastian, Caro. Will definitely book more flights :)","(Translated by Google) Flying is great and the flight instructors are nice too. Unfortunately, the corona rains are hardly noticed. In the catering area, no employee wears a mask, food and drink are prepared and brought without a mask, and there are no slices. An employee enjoyed four times loudly into the handkerchief and twice loudly blown his nose and then continued to cash in without washing his hands (still without a mask) and made coffee. Incredible to me, but when asked about it, they just rolled their eyes. And that one day before the partial lockdown, unfortunately you shouldn't be surprised that such measures are necessary. A pity!!!!

Seating is blocked

On 08.06.19 I visited the show ""The Illusionists"" in Essen with my company.

Unfortunately, we were very surprised that our seats in the best upper-range were closed with a straight view to the stage and therefore were no longer available.

Therefore, we had to look very far back and also diagonally to the stage, because the ""better free"" seats were already occupied.
We did not get any information in advance to have a chance to get better seats.

According to the provided seating plan, we were now in Category 4 instead of the paid Category 2 !! Had we known this when booking, we would never have visited this show.

That's why we contacted Hurricane Factory Berlin GmbH right after the event. Then came an email that we should send the tickets / invoice etc. We did this immediately, since then no reaction, several deadlines are ignored !!!

We will definitely avoid Hurricane Factory Events

Ich habe am 08.06.19 mit meiner Begleitung die Show ""The Illusionists"" in Essen besucht.

Leider waren wir doch arg verwundert, dass unsere Pl√§tze im besten Oberrangbereich mit geraden Blick zur B√ºhne geschlossen waren und deswegen nicht mehr verf√ºgbar waren.

Daher mussten wir nun sehr weit hinten und auch schr√§g zur B√ºhne schauen, da die ""besseren freien"" Pl√§tze bereits belegt waren.
Wir haben im vorhinein keinerlei Information diesbez√ºglich bekommen um eine Chance zu haben an bessere Pl√§tze zu gelangen.

Daher haben wir Hurrican Factory Berlin GmbH direkt nach dem Event angeschrieben. Daraufhin kam eine Mail, dass wir die Tickets/Rechnung etc zusenden sollen. Dies haben wir sofort gemacht, seitdem keine Reaktion, mehrere gestellte Fristen werden ignoriert!!!

I enjoyed walking around the area too. The location of the gallery is ideal. It is not far from the train station and there are plenty of shops nearby. Highly recommended to everyone üá©üá™",East side gallery is also one of the major tourist attraction. It‚Äôs a perfect place for all the art lovers. The whole wall till the end showcases unique and creative artwork. Each wall is different from an other. Totally worth visiting this place in Berlin.,If you ever get  to Berlin  you just got to visit the wall.  Take your time   and bring a comfortable  pair of shoes.   Each painting has to b looked at in detail....I actually  recommend  you go to the far side of the street to view them.. you will be amazed  at just how much  detail you will have missed if you don't. Enjoy,"Another way to milk emotions from people who understand nothing about the communist era. It wasn't too bad for most people to live behind the Wall. It was weird and schizoid, but not necessarily bad. The art is inspiring, though.","The art is not good. It is time to replace the murals with work from artists who know how know to do it well. There is so much amazing street art in the world, Berlin needs to tap into that.","Just writing this review for future tourist to be careful of the scammers that are there at the Berlin Wall. There is a group of 5 people that lure you into a game and they play together to make you think that you can win. They put a silver ball into three boxes and move it around but they have a magnet in their hand which moves the ball. We reported to the German Police but they did not do anything and acted like they didn‚Äôt care. Please be aware of these people. See photos for their faces. I took pictures and videos of them and called the police so they gave us the money back.

I like the whole set up and decoration of the stalls. There is also live music performance which I enjoyed very much. Because of Covid they asked for your vaccination pass. Also prepare one euro for the entry. Overall it was an awesome experience,this is where the rascals from the villages come to play the game of cops and robbers with the municipal tasks.  it's a big place that's great for hiding because there are no trees at all.  Even the pretty fountain offers little privacy.  it's fun when you have to count more than ten to get out of sight of the other person,"It was a normal day, but it has something breathtaking within! I really love looking at this airy place! A lot of space, a lot of beautiful architecture. I can feel the calm there simultaniously feeling the seriousness of the history that happened there.","everything is fenced off, impossible to take photos, come closer. no working activity inside","They don't recognise covid vaccination from NHS (United Kingdom) so unless you want to waste your time arguing or trying to teach them how to evaluate vaccination Pass from the UK, avoid visiting. They don't speak English either so communication was almost impossible.","People were checked in the best traditions of Moscow - security felt, looked at bags, forced to throw things away, not offering a place for storage. Because of this, people crowded. All this does not solve security problems: from the fact that people are asked to throw out sandwiches or Coke, it will not become safer, and the mood is spoiled."
DDR Museum,4.3,Museum,"Vera Britain Ufer, Karl-Liebknecht-Str. 1, 10178 Berlin, Germany",ddr-museum.de,Very interesting museum about life in East Berlin (East Germany) post WWII. Great atmosphere with a lot of information and interactive exhibits. I personally really enjoyed the apartment set up at the end of the museum tour. So cool to see how people lived during that time inclusive of TV shows you can watch that demonstrated what East Germans could watch and what West Germans could watch. This is well worth a visit while in Berlin.,"It is a very cool museum, and they present the history very interactively. Absolutely worth to visit if you are interested in the history of Berlin and the East German socialism. If you are interested in motorcycles, you can even buy the combined ticket with the DDR motorcycle museum (it is a smaller one, but they have some nice old pieces).","From outside, it can look like a small museum but there are so many things to read and appreciate that you will spend around 2/2.5 hours to visit it all. The heritage is exquisite, and the art curators make totally sure to conserve them in perfect conditions. The museum is divided in different rooms where you not only see objects, but where you can also interact with signs, objects and rooms, making it a whole different experience from history museums. They walk you through the history of the DDR, since daily life habits to politics, economy, military, university and others. The price is quite acceptable only 12 euros and you have access to lockers for free. At the end of the visit, I recommend you to visit the store where you can buy funny souvenirs and beautiful postcards.","First of all, we didn‚Äôt receive our online tickets. The impolite staff let us in anyway, which was nice, but we couldn‚Äôt move around inside without the ticket. I‚Äôve never seen so many people in a museum before, and we didn‚Äôt get to see a single part of the exhibition before we ran for the nearest exit - which we had to climb over because we still didn‚Äôt have a ticket. The museum is probably interesting, but they led to many people in in our case.","A haunted house take on the DDR, down to a large portrait of Marx with eyes that follow you around. Treats it‚Äôs subject with real disdain.","You could not imagine a more biased and simplistic exhibition. The lack of any context or objectivity makes it completely non-sense.

December 13, 2016 11 years old. A birthday afternoon was planned at Lasertec.
In the inquiries in advance, we were assured that there is no age limit, that rather a power of attorney from the participating children / birthday guests must be present and the children have to bring sports equipment.
Everything was organized. On the way to Lasertec, 1 birthday guest lost his sports bag, which we had to look for. We called Lasertec to announce our slight delay, which was disapproved.
Finally, we arrived with only 10 minutes late at the destination. There we were told by a very grumpy staff that the Lasertec games due to our delay and because of the age of the birthday guests is not allowed us.
The children were seriously disappointed and we adults were so perplexed and shocked, especially since Lasertec in the text of the consent for minors extra lists: ""... There is no age limit for playing"" LaserTag ""...""

13. Dezember 2016 11 Jahre alt geworden. Geplant war ein Geburtstagsnachmittag bei Lasertec.

Friedrichstadt-Palast,4.7,Performing arts theater,"Friedrichstra√üe 107, 10117 Berlin, Germany",palast.berlin,Great theater with amazing acoustics. It is amphitheatric so don t bother having a good seat. You can enjoy the show wherever your seat is. I saw a very nice musical called The One and all the dresses were made from Jean Paul Gaultier. Another must place to visit while you are in Berlin. Recommended!,"Building :
The building itself is perfect for shows, the shape offers an excellent visibility on the stage from everywhere. I was on the last rows but i could enjoy the stage normally. Compared with most french and London theatres, seats are pretty large and comfy, have more room for the legs than what i am usually used to. Ticket collection is outdoor, you first have to queue at the box office on the right of the palast outside, then queue again to enter the theatre.

Show seen ‚ÄúARISE‚Äù:
Had a pleasant and entertaining night, what I appreciated the most are the acrobatics, the costumes and the scenery. The acrobatics were impressive (the athletes were better than Cirque du Soleil), they managed to create a setting with water which left everybody amazed (front rows were splashed üòÇ).
Only downside is half the dialogues are german, half english. As a foreigner, couldn‚Äôt understand half the conversations (same for germans who don‚Äôt understand english‚Ä¶). Why don‚Äôt they display English subtitles on the scene and leave all conversations in german (while leaving the songs 50% German/50% English though)?","Show watched: ARise
Show time: 65min/25min interval/ 65min

Language
Show is in a mix of English and German. But that doesn‚Äôt really matter because the acts and visual spectacle can better translate the whole story, feel and emotions.

Dance
Choreography is seamless and fantastic with only mere moments of transition giving u barely enough time to comprehend until the applauses reacts. From cabaret style to pop and aerial ballet, it was a fusion of both art and form.

Music
From rapping to Maksim like crossovers with dashes of solo and strings akin to that of Vivaldi, it was the perfect ensemble. All music are performed live and performers shown at spots and locations around the stage.

Stage
The smart use of levelling for performers, lights and depth of field with a central rotating stage was something I haven‚Äôt seen since David copper field magic acts. Stage technology used here have accentuated the story telling element regardless where u r seated.

Performers
This show celebrates diversity in all forms. From LGBT to soloist of different Colours, the director has truly incorporated what it means for us to be in an inclusive world.

Storyline (based on my own interpretation as I do not understand German)
The pratogonist is a photographer. Struggling with the loss of what to shoot, he consulted with Time to find back his inspiration. Time brought him back with his Muse, calls him to revisit his past works to induce inception. With the help of light, he found back his muse.

The review.
A must watch if anyone is in Berlin. Do remember to book tickets waaay in advance as it‚Äôs almost full every single day. Being a fervent theatre/play/musical/orchestral goer, this show truly transcends my expectations. The music is original and fits the story telling from intro to climax, the theatre costumes details is fine and does lose to broadway types plays. Ticket prices are way cheaper if u compare it to actual full fledge plays/musicals. I don‚Äôt usually recommend front row seats as they are exorbitantly priced and not worth the experience. This show however, I totally recommend it.","It's said it's good for non German speakers... No, it's not, don't waste your money if you don't understand German.
There is no plot, it's a bunch of scenes with no sense between them.","I visited this beautiful cinema during the Berlinale. I was slightly late for the screening along with a few others. We were made to wait outside until the intro was over, which I didn‚Äôt mind, but after the intro had finished, we were all walked up a few flights of stairs to a balcony level, only arriving in our seats after the cinema was completely dark, without help of a flashlight to take the seats and the film had started. There was plenty of seats free on the ground level.

During the screening of this Brazilian film which dealt with the struggle of freedom fighters and oppression under the dictatorship, the ushers hovered around the cinema like prison guards. Them walking up and down the stairs was very distracting - it was like someone going to the toilets every few moments. Afterwards I asked an usher outside and they confirmed that the ushers inside the screen are not allowed to sit during the screenings. It would be a lot more settling and a more calm experience if the ushers were just allowed to sit and observe the audience from a good vantage point. I could even see most of the audience from where I was sitting.

To add insult to injury, despite these free-roaming ushers, I saw several people in the crowd taking their phones out for even quite a while and nothing was done. Towards the end of the film, I saw people take photos of the screen.

Beautiful building, but I wouldn‚Äôt attend for a screening again. Maybe a musical concert or a talk.","If you're a contemporary performing artist, you're not going to enjoy this. The shows are meant as pure entertainment. Remember getting dragged to that dinner theatre show because someone said you liked the arts? It's like that except at least here they put money into the stage, and you aren't forced to eat a cheap and overdone steak with soggy lettuce on the side. The staff are friendly and welcoming, and there are definitely a couple of acts in the show that are great, but everything else in between is pretty boring filler, uninspiring, and generic. The show is good for little kids and highschool kids that want to seem fancy, and also great for old grandparents and your parents who keep asking you when you're going to ""go back to school and get a real job"" because your artist life wasn't the doctorate degree they were hoping for."
Victory Column,4.6,Monument,"Gro√üer Stern, 10557 Berlin, Germany",berlin.de,"This cost 4 euros for an adult, it's a spiral staircase all the way up, too small for an elevator. That's quite a climb, they do have stopping points where you can stop and take a break but other people will be wiggling by.  What you do get up there, There's a really nice view of the whole city, it was really pretty from up there. If you're okay with the 4 euro and climbing a bunch of stairs, then it's a good deal!","A place worth visiting. There are a few reasons you should do that:
1. Great panoramic view on Berlin
2. Interesting museum indoors
3. Exercise climbing 200+ stairs

First of all, don‚Äôt cross the road, you can get there using underground passes from east and west side of the column.
I paid 3.5 EUR to enter. Only cash.

Secondly, be careful on the stairs. It has little areas after each stair case, you can get some rest if you are tired climbing and pass some people through.

I recommend visiting this place either at golden hour, after, or in the morning. Views are going to be the best during these hours.","Beautiful view and a wonderful experience.

Lasergame Berlin GmbH,4.7,Laser tag center,"√ñffnung nur nach Buchung, Wilhelminenhofstra√üe 89, 12459 Berlin, Germany",spielt-lasertag.de,"We celebrated a young boy's birthday there - organized as a group event. Everyone had a great time, thanks largely to the friendly staff on hand. They are helpful and pragmatic.
The group left having had a very good time, the kids were happy.
We can recommend the ""Spaceship""!!","Went here with a big group and it was really a lot of fun! I wasn't a big fan of laser tag before but this place changed my mind about that. Everything was in clean, in good order, and the staff member on duty (Ivan) kept everything running smoothly. Had a great time here.","Great fun, interesting game modes and friendly staff! Would go again!","(Translated by Google) That was my second time laser tag, the first time on this facility... I'm very disappointed... There were a total of 22 players on the ""battlefield""... Far too many to act tactically... There you are advised not to run, you could be sure if you saw an opponent, you would be shot from behind by another... In addition, after a hit you are incapacitated for a few seconds, time in which you change your location should... Just like when there's someone on every corner?!
That really wasn't fun...
The explanations were also poor, the second game was about conquering or destroying bases... Where these are located and that you simply don't have a home base but can attack and destroy each one is lost...
The power ups are a nice idea but get lost in a game with so many players.
Also, I'm not a fan at all of the flashing vests that announce you around the corner because you can see your light...

I was at another facility the day before, there were only helmets, so only headshots... With handguns, also much better than the toy laser guns, which gave away your location directly because everyone can see the beam.

To make it short: the operator received 30 euros each for 2 hours from 22 players and I didn't have any fun because it was too crowded and I don't like the equipment etc... The playmodes aren't good either, by the way, I find that after one Time to respawn sucks, then it's better to only respawn in your own base, so you can hit an opponent and be sure that he's not waiting behind you to catch you...

Only 1 star for the reasons mentioned... Never again for me!

*Addendum because I only now saw that I was answered*

To present myself here as a fan of another system (I have been to laser tag twice in my life, and this one was the worse one for the reasons mentioned) is a bit poor and it is even more evidence of unprofessionalism to throw into the room that I diligently write reviews for the other facility or am a competitor. This is ridiculous, just looking at my account and the other reviews is easy to see. Unless you really think that I rarely rate places with the account and over the years just to strike a big blow against you now üòÇ
But please believe what you want.

Further on in the text, I didn't book anything, but we came to you among friends. In the end I can only evaluate what I have experienced and I have. I'm sorry if you don't like it, but that's how ratings work, an evaluator does not have a complete overview, but only an excerpt... That should also be clear to you üôÑ I can hardly give 5 stars because you also have others offers things that I haven't experienced, right? Exactly, thanks.
And my experience as an excerpt from your offer was only worth 1 star to me.

But that's not so tragic either, you have enough other positive reviews (if they aren't all from you *pumm* conspiracy theory smashed back)

Thanks for the attention!

(Original)
Das war mein zweites Mal Lasertag, dass erste mal auf dieser Anlage... Ich bin sehr entt√§uscht... Es gab insgesamt 22 Spieler auf dem ""Schlachtfeld""... Viel zu viele als das man hatte taktisch vorgehen k√∂nnen... Da man darauf hingewiesen wird nicht zu rennen konnte man sicher sein, wenn man eine  Gegner gesehen hat, w√ºrde man schon von hinten von einem anderen abgeschossen... Dazu kommt das man nach einem Treffer einige Sekunden kampfunf√§hig ist,zeit in der man seine  Standort wechseln sollte... Nur wie wenn an jeder Ecke jemand steht?!
Das hat echt keinen Spa√ü gemacht...
Die Erkl√§rungen waren auch d√ºrftig, im zweiten Spiel ging es darum Basen zu erobern bzw. Zu zerst√∂ren... Wo diese sich befinden und das man einfach keine homebase hat sondern jede angreifen und zerst√∂ren kann ist untergegangen...
Die power ups sind eine nette Idee, gehen bei einem Spiel mit so vielen Teilnehmern aber unter.
Auch bin ich √ºberhaupt kein Fan von den blinkewesten die dich bereits um die Ecke ank√ºndigen da man dein Licht sieht...

Ich war am Vortag auf einer anderen Anlage, da gab es nur Helme, also nur headshots... Mit handfeuerwaffen, auch wesentlich besser als die Spielzeuglaserwaffen, die direkt deinen Standort verraten haben weil jeder den strahl sehen kann.

Ums kurz zu machen: der Betreiber hat f√ºr 2 Stunden von 22 Spielern je 30 Euro erhalten und ich hatte keinen Spa√ü weil es zu voll war und ich das Equipment etc nicht gut finde... Die playmodes √ºbrigens auch nicht, ich finde das nach einer Zeit respawnen doof, dann lieber nur in der eigenen Basis respawnwnz, so kann man einen Gegner treffen und sicher sein das er nicht hinter dir wartet um dich zu erwischen...

Aus den genannten Gr√ºnden nur 1 Stern... Nie wieder f√ºr mich!

*Nachtrag da ich jetzt erst gesehen habe das mir geantwortet wurde*

Mich hier nun als Fan einer anderen Anlage hinzustellen (ich war 2 mal in meinem Leben beim Lasertag, und dieses hier war das schlechtere aus genannten Gr√ºnden) ist schon etwas arm und noch mehr zeugt es von Unprofessionalit√§t in den Raum zu werfen, das ich fleissig f√ºr die andere Anlage Rezensionen schreibe oder ein Konkurrent bin. Das ist l√§cherlich, durch ein einfaches Ansehen meines Accounts und der anderen Bewertungen ist das simpel zu sehen. Es sei denn ihr seid echt der Meinung das ich mit dem Account selten und √ºber Jahre hinweg Orte bewerte nur um jetzt zum gro√üen Schlag gegen euch auszuholen üòÇ
Aber bitte glaubt was ihr wollt.

Weiter im Text, ich habe nichts gebucht, sondern wir sind unter Freunden zu euch gekommen. Im Endeffekt kann ich also nur das bewerten was ich erlebt habe und das habe ich auch. Wenn euch das nicht passt tut es mir leid, aber so funktionieren Bewertungen nunmal, ein Bewerter hat keinen kompletten √úberblick sondern immer nur einen Ausschnitt... Auch das sollte euch eigentlich klar sein üôÑ ich kann ja wohl schlecht 5 Sterne geben weil ihr auch andere Sachen anbietet die ich aber nicht erlebt habe oder? Genau, danke.
Und mein Erlebnis als Ausschnitt von eurem Angebot war mir nur 1 Stern wert.

Been training here for almost 4 years and never regretted once ;),"Below average gym with hygiene issues and terrible management. Despite their copy paste review response to ""contact them directly"" multiple attmepts to do so were ignored.","(Translated by Google) So I've trained in several gyms. (Black House Miami Beach, AKA San Jose, MMA Berlin, etc.) but Spitfire was definitely my least favorite. Here is a short summary:

+ nice reception
+ a trainer was fine (boxing)
+ nice artwork on the wall
- the training mentality of many members is very aggressive:
I sparred with a member who couldn't handle the fact that I was better than him. He then freaked out and tried to hit me with all his might, it was my fault then. we previously saved in light contact.
- there was a case where a new member (female) was repeatedly teased by another member. it was up to the coach to settle the situation, but he didn't do anything. the woman understandably left the training before the end.
- one trainer was always quite aggressive: in a unit for beginners he sparred with youngsters (max. 14 years) until they were on the ground from pain, then he continued with the next one until he was also on the ground
- Much more expensive than comparable gyms
- unfriendly management, I wanted to cancel my contract but was a day late, no goodwill at all
- crowded training rooms, stuffy air
- at the grappling courses it was noticed that some members are on steroids

I've also spoken to other members, sparring is done so hard that many can't think straight afterwards. If that's how you like to train, fine with me. But anyone who wants to practice martial arts for a long time knows that this is not the right philosophy. Those were only my personal impressions, I'm sure it was better with some others, but I can't recommend anyone to train there unless you like to soften your head every time.

(Original)
Also ich habe bereits in mehreren Gyms trainiert. (Black House Miami Beach, AKA San Jose, MMA Berlin, etc.) aber Spitfire hat mir definitiv am wenigsten gefallen. Hier eine kurze Zusammenfassung:

+ nette Rezeption
+ ein Trainer war in Ordnung (Boxen)
+ sch√∂nes Artwork an der Wand
- die Trainingsmentalit√§t bei vielen Mitgliedern ist sehr aggressiv:
Ich habe mit einem Mitglied Sparring gemacht, welcher nicht verkraftet hat, dass ich besser gewesen bin als er. Daraufhin ist er ausgerastet und hat versucht mich mit voller Kraft umzuhauen, die Schuld lag dann bei mir. wir haben zuvor im Leichtkontakt gesparrt.
- es gab einen Fall, wo ein neues Mitglied (weiblich) von einem anderen Mitglied immer wieder dumm angemacht wurde. es lag am Trainer die Situation zu schlichten, aber der hat nichts gemacht. die Frau hat das Training verst√§ndlicherweise vor Ende verlassen.
- ein Trainer war immer ziemlich aggressiv: in einer Einheit f√ºr Anf√§nger hat er mit Jugendlichen (max. 14 Jahre) Sparring gemacht bis sie am Boden lagen vor Schmerzen, dann hat er mit dem n√§chsten weiter gemacht bis dieser auch am Boden lag
- sehr viel teuerer als vergleichbare Gyms
- unfreundliches Management, ich wollte meinen Vertrag k√ºndigen, war aber einen Tag zu sp√§t, √ºberhaupt keine Kulanz
- √ºberf√ºllte Trainingsr√§ume, stickige Luft
- bei den Grappling Kursen hat man gemerkt, dass einige Mitglieder auf Steroiden sind

Ich habe auch mit anderen Mitgliedern gesprochen, es wird so hart Sparring gemacht, dass viele danach nicht mehr klar denken k√∂nnen. Wenn Ihr gerne so trainiert, von mir aus. Aber jeder der lange Kampfsport betreiben m√∂chte weiss, dass das nicht die richtige Philosophie ist. Das waren auch nur meine pers√∂nlichen Eindr√ºcke, bestimmt ist es bei manchen anderen besser gewesen, aber ich kann niemanden empfehlen dort zu trainieren au√üer man steht darauf sich jedes mal die Birne weich zu hauen.","(Translated by Google) Very small hardly space to move

We have already been guests in several A320 flight simulators and therefore have a very good opportunity for comparison.

The computer system crashed several times and the flight had to be interrupted. Windows processes had to be restarted. The machine sound kept breaking off briefly or the flight software froze. The graphics were rather bad and the screen for the flight projection was too close to the aircraft, so that the sky and the surroundings looked very unreal. Better systems would allow the screens to be positioned farther away and make the flying experience one too.

We had previously asked the team for a ColdAndDark flight, which was also confirmed by email. Unfortunately, the machine was already on and most of the flight plan was entered.
There was no way for a realistic radio to the tower or ground crew.
The operating technology seemed rather old and should have been overhauled and renewed long ago. The seats are partially damaged and hanging from loose floor screws.
Some of the controls could not be operated from the pilot's seat because they were not working. In some cases, flight data could only be seen on the copilot's monitor.

Luckily we had bought the voucher for it cheaper at Groupon, otherwise the price-performance ratio would have been completely gone.

The co-pilot was nice and explained a lot of things well.

We hope that JetSim will update its system as soon as possible and then really be able to offer the flying fun that the team promises.

**************
Response to ""Response from the owner""

Thank you very much for your information.
We pointed out on site that we would have liked to start the system ColdAndDark and have all flight plans and data with us, but the instructor told us that the aircraft is already on (APU, GroundPower etc...), he likes to set our flight plan and we should start like this after all.
Apparently we should have insisted more.

Leider waren wir nach unserem gestrigem Flug eher entt√§uscht als erfreut. Wir waren schon in mehreren A320 Flugsimulatoren zu Gast und haben daher eine sehr gute Vergleichsm√∂glichkeit.

Das ComputerSystem ist mehrfach abgest√ºrzt und der Flug musste unterbrochen werden. Windows Prozesse mussten neu gestartet werden. Der Maschinensound brach immer wieder kurz ab bzw. fror die Flugsoftware ein. Die Grafik war eher schlecht und die Leinwand f√ºr die Flugprojektion zu dicht am Flugzeug, sodass teils der Himmel und die Umgebung sehr unrealistisch wirkte. Besser Systeme w√ºrden es gestatten, die Leinw√§nde weiter weg zu positionieren und das Flugerlebnis auch zu einem zu machen.

Wir hatten vorab das Team f√ºr einen ColdAndDark Flug angefragt, was auch per Mail best√§tigt wurde. Leider war dann doch die Maschine schon an und der Flugplan gr√∂√ütenteils eingegeben.
Es gab keine M√∂glichkeit f√ºr einen realistischen Funk zum Tower oder Bodencrew.
Die Bedientechnik wirkte eher seht alt und h√§tte l√§ngst schon einmal √ºberholt und erneuert werden sollen. Die Sitze sind teilweise besch√§digt und h√§ngen an losen Bodenschrauben.
Bedienelement konnten teilweise vom Pilotensitz aus nicht bedient werden, da diese nicht funktionierten. Flugdaten waren teilweise nur auf Monitoren des Copiloten zu sehen.

Wir hatten den Gutschein daf√ºr zum Gl√ºck g√ºnstiger bei Groupon gekauft, sonst w√§re das Preis-Leistungsverh√§ltnis komplett gesprengt worden.

Der Copilot war nett und hat viele Dinge gut erkl√§rt.

Wir hoffen, dass JetSim sein System so bald wie m√∂glich erneuert und dann wirklich wieder den Flugspa√ü anbieten kann, welchen das Team verspricht.

Antwort auf ""Antwort vom Inhaber""

Vielen Dank f√ºr Ihre Informationen.
Wir haben vor Ort darauf hinweisen, dass das wir das System gerne ColdAndDark gestartet h√§tten und alle Flugpl√§ne und Daten dabei haben, jedoch wurde uns vom Instrukteur mitgeteilt, dass das Flugzeug nun aber schon an ist (APU, GroundPower etc...), er unseren Flugplan gerne einstellt und wir dann doch so starten sollten.
Wir h√§tten dabei scheinbar mehr insistieren sollen.","(Translated by Google) Unfortunately, the simulator sometimes refused to work (technical problems, ""freeze""), which is why the experience was a bit clouded. The graphics also look a bit older, but have no comparison to other ""professional"" simulators. The current MFS2020 already has at least a higher resolution display. The support on site and via email, also because of the corona-related restrictions, was good. The voucher was easily extended several times, thanks for that! I can recommend it for a first impression, but only if the technical problems are resolved. If such problems are known in good time, the appointments that take place on that day should be postponed by telephone or e-mail.

Leider verweigerte der Simulator teilweise seinen Dienst (technische Probleme, ""Freeze""), weshalb das Erlebnis etwas getr√ºbt wurde. Die Grafik wirkt auch etwas √§lter schon, habe allerdings keinen Vergleich zu anderen ""professionellen"" Simulatoren. Der aktuelle MFS2020 hat zumindest bereits eine hochaufl√∂sendere Anzeige. Die Betreuung vor Ort und √ºber E-Mail, auch wegen der coronabedingten Einschr√§nkungen, war gut. Der Gutschein wurde unkompliziert mehrmals verl√§ngert, danke daf√ºr! Ich kann es f√ºr einen ersten Eindruck empfehlen, allerdings nur dann, wenn die technischen Probleme behoben werden. Wenn solche Probleme rechtzeitig bekannt sind, sollten die an diesem Tag stattfindenden Termine telefonisch oder per E-Mail verschoben werden."

Gem√§ldegalerie,4.6,Art museum,"Matth√§ikirchplatz, 10785 Berlin, Germany",smb.museum,Rich collection of portraits including 8 paintings by Albrecht Durer. It also has a self portrait of Raphael. The audio guide is included with the admission price and gives great information on many of the paintings.,The gallery is very beautiful and a must see in Berlin. They have quite an impressive collection of Italian Renaissance,"very beautiful museum in which you can easily spend hours looking at mostly ""bondieuseries"" and traditional european renaissance paintings! the price is quite cheap and there's a student refund which is always a plus! at the moment until july there's an exhibition about tolerance which was very interesting","A beautiful collection, we had an enchanting time while visiting. But we give such a low score because the services offered are not up to the expectations: we waited after our visit for 40 minutes at the cafeteria, where only one person was working, and when we finally were able to order our lunch, nothing that was on the menu was available. The waitress was rude, touched our Covid masks, and was terribly slow - chatting with customers is not an option if you have an hour queue behind.","Fist visit attempt on Thursday April, 7. Noted on website open until 8 pm on Thursday. Arrived at 5:30. The cashier sells us tickets without warning us that the museum closes at 6 !
25 mn to visit...
Coming back today at 3:30 : no tickets before 5:00 pm, even if we were robbed on first visit, and even if we have to fly, and go to airport around 5:30.
Person at the cash inflexible.
No sense of welcoming and trying to repare an error.
Ee could not really see the Gemalde.
Really awful welcome !!
Too bad when you have a so nice collection.","It might be almost cliche to say that art museum gaurds are not the friendliest of people, but such was the case today. More importantly, for visitors from out of town not accustomed to German museum going policy, be prepared for rudeness and be aware that there is  'mandatory' check-in of your personal belongings. You need EXACT change in order to place your bag in a locker. If you don't have exact change, it will be frowned upon.

More importantly, it is also 'mandatory', apparently, to leave your jacket or coat with the coat check. As absurd as it is to enforce checking in even your jacket, it is even more absurd to single out people to enforce this rule and openly allow others to break it.

Overall the guard would not allow me to enter because I was wearing a jacket, but as I spoke with him, 3-5 people wearing jackets were coming out of the exhibition door. All were white. I hate to mention anything about race or racism ( it's honestly the last conclusion I would like draw) but could not help consider this would be a motivating factor for the guard not allowing me in (but letting in other random white people who broke this rule ( btw, I am brown, male). I personally did not not know this was an enforced rule ( I'm ok to check the bag) but it's definitely going overboard for an institution, especially a cultural one, to mandate and enforce the check in of simple jackets (where I carry all my personal items).

You might say, what's my problem? Don't be so sensitive, it's just a jacket, man! But the way in which certain rules are created, enforced, no matter how nonsensical and overall go completely unquestioned and accepted by the culture at large, (specifically art institutions in Berlin Germany ) just baffles my mind.

Overall, the guard was rude and the staff seem to be non human soulless individuals, doing a job, enforcing rules, allowing chosen people to break those rules. I suppose we the common people should be ever so grateful to be allowed to witness the rich and cultural life that they go so provide us with. I would not be surprised if the next thing they mandate is your underwear.

I love art but I will never return here. Fu&k art museums in Berlin.

The kids were looking around the store and one of the carton displays were unfortunately damaged. One of the female staff members came running over and in a rude way shouted ‚Äúthank you now it‚Äôs broken‚Äù we were shocked about that behaviour and the kids were sad and wanted to go home.

When I went to the cashier to pay for the chocolate the other female staff pointed at one of the other kids and said ‚ÄúBe more careful it‚Äôs not nice you come in and brake stuff‚Äù

I was furies about that rude and arrogant treatment and this behaviour should not be accepted by the company.

THE CENTER Activities in English STUDIO 1,5.0,Ballet school,"Esmarchstra√üe 5, 10407 Berlin, Germany",thecenter-berlin.de,"We have had such a pleasant time at The Centre Berlin. All the instructors are excellent, skilled, creative and talented and more so really warm and affectionate. My daughter started when she was 3 year old and  settled very well since the instructors ( Veronica, Jemma, Maurice, Courtney) were very welcoming and truly engaging. We started with one class and moved to 3, that's how delightful the experience was. The way all of them beautifully integerate each and every child and their needs is amazing.
We wish we could have stayed longer  unfortunately it's time to move to our homeland.

It's been so relaxing for me to leave my daughter and have some fun time with the fantastic friends that I made with other mother's.
I would recommend it to anyone. Just go there and am sure both you and your kid will have a blast for sure.

Most importantly I would congratulate Martina for creating this beautiful space.truly appreciate the hardwork that she puts in to maintain.","The first time I stepped into the Center, my daughter was just a few months old and we joined the Baby music group. Not only was the teacher fantastic but those other Mothers would become my lifelong friends. Flash forward a couple of years and we returned when my daughter (now 3) wanted to start Ballet. So, we began and right away, she loved her teacher and loved going to her class. Then she wanted to add Musical Theater - so we did and again, she loves it. As for me, I have made new friends that I will cherish in my life yet again through the Center. I really think this is because the Center allows for conversation between Parents and allows the Kids (and I'm sure Adults as well) to learn at their pace while still making sure that they are trying and having a great time. It's always been a happy place for me in Berlin and I do hope that you will find it to be the same!","My ballet classes with Brittany is one of the bright of my week. I am always looking forward to these moment of work in such a happy and empowering atmosphere.
As adult, I was afraid to start ballet, I thought that it would be too late for me to learn anything or even progress. How wrong was I! The different teachers I had, and especially Brittany, always made me feel welcome, seen, and supported. They make sure you have a good time, but leave the class having learnt something and make some progress.

The museum was heartbreaking and difficult to go through, but the staff was lovely and making sure to follow the covid guidelines to keep their guests safe.

My one wish is that they should put clear signs that what you can listen to on the phones are stories from survivors. I thought it would be audio of the information of the room since there was a lot of text in that room, but my sister decided to listen and told me what it was, so I could listen too, and those stories were the most heartbreaking and powerful ones there. Please put up some clearer signs so more people get to experience those stories. They're important.","The sun was there, the air was blowing a little, but it was still hot, but I got freezed. The walls were so cold, soulless and numb. How an ideology affected people's lives could only be described as beautifully as this monument!

The persecuted people at that time probably also felt like these concretes. The people were cold, the system was ruthless, and society was insensitive.

Personally, it's a very meaningful place, so I went there for showing around to my friends.
It was quiet in the afternoon, so there weren't many people. It happened when I tried to go inside the Memorial and watch and appreciate it.
A crowd of gypsies came. They were made up of three men, two women, and they came up recklessly and threatened to sign on the paper.
I felt a great threat to the three women, and I clearly expressed my refusal. And one of the men came up threateningly, pulling his arms, screaming and telling him not to touch any more, and one of them suddenly touched and winked away.
I was so terrified and shocked that I came out of the Memorial.
There was a bodyguard there, and when I told him what had happened, he actively tried to find them. But the shape of the Memorial was seen from the outside, it was invisible inside, so one bodyguard seemed to far from enough.
I strongly think the place need to be more careful about patrols in order to maintain the meaning of Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe.","The monument is very suggestive and well done, but when I arrived here I wasn't able to feel any kind of emotions or have time of gathering, because of others tourists that were there. Many people jumped on the stones, others screamed and played into the monument. There were few police office, but they weren't enough. So a beautiful monument that has lost its meaning."

Berta Block,4.6,Rock climbing gym,"M√ºhlenstra√üe 62, 13189 Berlin, Germany",bertablock.de,"Very good boulder gym, in my opinion, best in Berlin.
Four big areas as seen in the photos
All levels from very easy to very hard.
Also different styles all over the place, balance, power, hanging, and so on.
There is also a bar where you can buy drinks and food.
Price is 10‚Ç¨ and you can rent the shoes there.

There is also a little gym and a Moon Board

One thing is missing however, they do not have a campus board or other specific climbing training material","Great Boulder with challenging and easy to try routes. The boulder is quite bit and there are all kind of routes. There is a nice training area and a yoga area.
I fully recommend this boulder even if you are only visiting.","Berta Block is one of my favourite places in Berlin. Everyone is super friendly... from staff to climbers. Routes are many and well thought out. Great for all levels. Generous stretching/yoga areas plus an area for strength training. There‚Äôs great pies, quiches and deserts... you can spend the whole day there if you want. Defiantly one of Berlins most important cultural places.","It's a decent place to climb but don't try to talk to people.

The first person I talked to yelled ""nein"" at me and walked away after I tried to initiate a conversation about the beta on a route. I barely managed to say the word ""sorry"" as an optional invitation to discuss it. 5-10 minutes later someone from staff came down to explain to me that this a safes pace and not everyone likes to talk about climbing, but they did not provide any guidelines for how to determine if you can say one word another person.

So, in conclusion, there's no way to know if people are open to talk about climbing and if you happen to pick the wrong person you will get yelled at and reprimanded by staff. Just shut up or leave I guess.. I certainly have never felt more uncomfortable at a climbing gym.","Horribly long registration at the reception which makes you do lots of unnecessary things.

They don‚Äôt rent out any lockers as well.

If you‚Äôre looking for a nice swimming experience. This is the right place.,"I'm very happy this place exists. The pool is a good temperature and clean, as are the locker rooms. It can get busy and there is some congestion in the lanes but that's kind of unavoidable in a public pool. For the people complaining about the unfriendliness at the Kasse, who cares? I don't need people smiling and wishing me a good day all the time. We're not in America.",Nice and helpful trainers. Swimming pools are lively. They could do a better job at keeping the showers cleaner though,"What a horrible experience. I am never coming back to this place.

First of all, the employees are VERY rude. They won‚Äôt help you if you don‚Äôt speak German. When we first arrived to purchase the tickets, the employees don‚Äôt speak any English, so we had to wait for another person to come and translate for us. When we finally were able to purchase the tickets, the translator told us that the German employee said in a very rude tone that we ‚Äòmust learn to speak German‚Äô.

There are no clear indications in English, so it was very hard to find the way to the Pool, and everyone was very rude. To go to the pool, you have to go thru the lockers and then thru the showers, where you get to see disgusting things.

We finally arrived to the pool, and there was no place leave my bag with my swimming equipment.

We went on a Thursday at noon (not supposed to be peak hour). All the lanes were crowded, with 5-8 people on every lane. It is clear that 95% of the people are not swimmers at all. You had to use the same lane to go back and forward with 8 different people, and one of them was very rude telling me that I couldn‚Äôt pass them because we all had to go at the same speed (pace). So I decided to change to the one and only ‚Äòfast lane‚Äô where there were at least 5 swimmers. All the swimmers on the fast lane were at least 60 years old, swimming at 2:20/100m pace or slower, so I had to pass every single one of them with people going in both direction. It was HORRIBLE and I got so frustrated that I only ended up doing 1/3 of my workout. THIS PLACE IS NOT THE PLACE TO GO IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO DO YOUR WORKOUT. IF YOU JUST WANT TO CHILL ON THE POOL MAYBE.

I was charged 5,5‚Ç¨ to share a lane with 8 other swimmers. Never coming back.",Google Maps says it is Open until 10 pm already closed at 7 pm!,Cooooold!

Basically, you put on a VR headset and sit in a special chair. The chair moves in accordance with the ride. You can chose from a wide selection of rides (roller coasters, dino rides, dragon flying, car racing, space adventures, undersea adventures, scary adventures, etc). The VR headsets seem to be a little low-res but that's only compared to normal screens. To be fair though, I haven't tried other VR headsets. The staff there was very courteous and helpful.

The community there is always very nice & it has a really relaxed feel. It is very spacious and there are loads great climbing routes. There are enough simple ones to keep beginners well entertained and enough difficult ones to keep you extremely challenged as you progress. They change them often too, which is great.

Linda (who fluently speaks both English and German) was fabulous and our daughter loved being in the water there with the other kids in the class. Each class was small, allowing for personal attention, and the classes were fun yet effective.
Mina was so helpful and flexible and overall our experience was a great one--our only regret was that we couldn't stay longer!","(Translated by Google) Small, fine swimming school in Kreuzberg.

It has 3 meter depth in all pool's area and actually designed to teach diving. As a result the water temperature is colder then in standard children's pools. My child was not accepted to make a swim course due to the low German language skills.,"(Translated by Google) So I only give the star to comment or to be able to rate, because this school doesn't even deserve a mention. Of the 60 minutes booked, only 20 minutes were really trained in the water. Furthermore, this is a plunge pool and not at all suitable for a group staying here (minimum 4 people). One of the swimming instructors has been busy previewing her ""foreign"" language skills to male swimmers & ignore the other glimmers. Overall an unpleasant experience. They also offered the lessons during the time when wonders was banned everywhere due to Corona measures. I have never experienced such a bad and greedy school or behavior that is not possible at all. The worst thing is that you are not allowed to shower there afterwards because some people came and the teacher wanted to get everyone out of the water at 10:59 in a hurry. And it's best not to change there for a long time and leave immediately. Baaaah.

There are two parts of the church which are open to public at the moment. One part has over 22750 stained glass windows in both blue and a bit of red. This part of the church is octagonal in shape and has a predominant presence of a suspended figure of Jesus in crucifix form which is a contrasting bright bronze structure on a rich blue background. The image at first sight left me awestruck. There is also a Karl Schuke organ at place which is impressive. Then on the other side of the church, there is a part of the church which was used for weddings and funerals until 1943 when it was damaged severely in bombing. It was since then left as is and is not used for any ceremonies anymore. The tall figure of Jesus, some of the marble work on the walls, the tiled ceiling and floor with designs is impressive. The dome of the church starts damaged and you can actually see it from inside as well as outside. There are images from commencement of church till date pasted on one section of the church.

Paint your Style,4.8,Recreation center,"Simplonstra√üe 8, 10245 Berlin, Germany",paintyourstyle.eu,"Absolutely beautiful place with amazing and kind staff that are happy to help through any part of the painting process. There is a large variety of items to paint and plenty of colours to choose from. We never felt rushed during the painting process and they were happy to book us in for another session for our piece that still needed more work at the end of the day.

It‚Äôs a pretty big place with multiple rooms so you don‚Äôt feel overwhelmed. There‚Äôs lots of information on painting techniques and the staff show you how to get started. The final products feel high quality!

There were people painting in groups, but also people there alone. All ages there too! So don‚Äôt worry if you‚Äôd like to go there by yourself for a relaxing afternoon :)",It was a really fun experience! You can book a table for 4h and just choose what you want to paint. Lots of color options and the personnel is nice and helpful,"A really lovely place. You can choose a piece, paint it the way you want and then receive it after 1-2 days. The staff is very helpful and friendly. They explain everything you need to know and answer all your questions.You definitely need to make an appointment beforehand.","It's fun, their staff are super nice, but the prices... Really really really overpriced. Hence only two stars.",,

Die Preise in dem kleinen Laden sind super fair, sowohl beim Ankauf und Verkauf. Der/die Mitarbeiter/in sind auch sehr freundlich.
Man f√ºhlt sich dort sofort wohl und gut aufgehoben, Fragen werden freundlich beantwortet. Auch Umtausch oder R√ºckgabe war nie ein Problem.

Sehr zu empfehlen","(Translated by Google) Very great store you can find what you are looking for

Sehr Toller laden man findet was man sucht","(Translated by Google) Very bad customer service. I bought a ps4 game and did not see that it is polish. Can I start with nothing because I only speak German. No extra information on the game itself. No exchange!

(Original)
Ganz schlechter Kundenservice. Habe ein ps4 Spiel gekauft und nicht gesehen dass es polnisch ist. Kann ich nichts mit anfangen da ich nur deutsch spreche. Auf dem Spiel selbst kein extra Hinweis dazu. Kein Umtausch!","(Translated by Google) Buying things well, in an emergency, yes, but selling something else, that's nice.

Sachen kaufen na ja Un Notfall ja aber was verkaufen nee sonst nett das wars .","(Translated by Google) Friendly staff. Prices z.T. VB.

MOTAWI Bowling,4.0,Bowling alley,"Zerpenschleuser Ring 37, 13439 Berlin, Germany",motawi.de,"Probably the biggest bowling alley in the city, there are total of 46 lanes available. They charge by hour per lane max 6 people hence the price is cheap. Four of us paid 6 euros per person inc shoes on a Thursday night. They also have 10 euro 1.5 litre pitchers.",An amazing place to enjoy your day..... Had a lot of fun.... üéäüéâ,"Fun bowling place with typical Berliner charm. Beer, drinks, and snacks are reasonably priced. Friday and Saturday nights are disco bowling--lots of fun with a ""host"" and free shots and candy.",We asked them to help us for setting bowling bumbers but they refused it because they were busy.,The food service is extremely poor. Took minutes for drinks and about 1hour for food.,I asked 5 times for drinks but i got it the 6 timed
Haubentaucher Berlin,3.5,Bar,"Revaler Str. 99, 10245 Berlin, Germany",haubentaucher.berlin,"Awesome location. Just going in it feels like going on holiday. Relaxed but stylish atmosphere, great venue for (afterwork) party and events",Really amazing location. A party location with pool and palms. Wow,"Nice place.....outdoor events, food and drinks inside but at a price not free..,first 2 drinks are for free., you pay with some plastic coins provided at the gate after you pay the entry fee.., ( during the day) .,tho ,NO food or beverage allowed..IN the venue (exertions)
Only if you got (small kids)..,can bring baby food for them..","They didn‚Äôt let us in because we were two guys. We are Students and don¬¥t look ultra rich. The Girls before us gave hugs to the staff outside, and entered for free. I think they are Promoters inside. I‚Äôm giving one star because this information wasn‚Äôt stated anywhere. You can set your own rules as a place owner but you should make them visible to your guests and so that no one goes there (and probably from a very far place) to get surprised that they‚Äôre not allowed.","The vibe depends a lot on the promoter. Inform yourself before going there or you wont get in.
Have a second plan on a hot day if you just want to swim in a group.","such a racist and dubious selection never experienced before, an impertinence that you are rejected with the words: not today, with the reason you have not reserved, but you see how behind you directly a German customer without reservation is let in. we wanted to get a bottle and enjoy our Berlin holiday on a hot summer day. unfortunately, the extremely rude woman at the door ruined this day.  never again if you don't want our money... definitly not to be recommended for an international audience"
myToys,3.9,Toy store,"Arcaden im UG, Karl-Marx-Stra√üe 66, 12043 Berlin, Germany",mytoys.de,"I absolutely love this store.  The employees are fantastic, patient and knowledgeable. They have a wonderful assortment of products or can easily and quickly order anything directly to the store if needed.  There's also a fun bargain department in the back where one can find some really great deals.   They do speak English and they are very understanding and attentive to those who don't speak/understand German.  The only drawback is that this store is occasionally overrun by unsupervised, destructive children.  So it's definitely best to go during off hours to avoid the riff raff.",Great collection of stuff but a bit heavier on pocket.,Ok,"Many boxes are open. But staff does not allow to check content until you buy an item.

I found very nice Brio rail road. Box was re-sealed. Second seal was ripped. And you know. In a box were trees, animals some buildings and NO TRAIN and railroad.

Also, I looked on scooters. I need my kid to try it to select one with proper height. I pulled one from opened  box. And one guy from a staff said that I have to buy it.

I came to the shop to buy proper stuff and they does not allow to do it.","‚Äúcash only! - sorry""","(Translated by Google) I find this toy chain to be unfriendly to customers, lacking service and threats when buying on account if payment is not made immediately one day later. But nobody needs to be afraid of debt collection companies, since they have no rights whatsoever, if you don't react, you don't enter into a relationship with them according to commercial law and therefore don't react to threats or even agree to an installment payment, not even call them. I am writing this as an indication that the toy chain is threatening collection immediately. Of course you should already pay your bill to the toy company, but as in my case, I thought I had already made the payment via PayPal.

(Original)
Diese Spielzeugkette empfinde ich als Kundenunfreundlich, mangelnder Service und Drohungen bei Kauf auf Rechnung, wenn ein Tag sp√§ter nicht gleich bezahlt wurde. Aber Keiner braucht vor Inkasso Firmen Angst haben, da die keinerlei Rechte haben, wenn man nicht reagiert, geht man auch keine Handlungsbeziehun laut Handelrecht mit denen ein und daher nicht auf Drohungen reagieren oder sich gar auf eine Ratenzahlung einlassen, auch nicht anrufen. Ich schreibe dies als Hinweis das die Spiezeugkette mit Inkasso sofort droht. Selbstverst√§nlich sollte man schon an die Spielzeugfirma seine Rechnung bezahlen, doch wie in meinem Fall, dachte ich die Bezahlung h√§tte ich schon √ºber PayPal get√§tigt."

Citygolf Berlin,4.2,Miniature golf course,"Wittenberger Str. 50, 12689 Berlin, Germany",citygolfberlin.de,Nice fun activity.,Top,"(Translated by Google) We went there to play mini golf today and then enjoyed beer and currywurst in the sun.

Beautiful and well-kept facility. Friendly service and good prices.

Clear recommendation.

Wir waren heute dort Minigolf spielen und haben im Anschluss Bier und Currywurst in der Sonne genossen.

Sch√∂ne und gepflegte Anlage. Freundliche Bedienung und gute Preise.

Klare Empfehlung.","(Translated by Google) just been there Our 4 year old son was not allowed to play. Lanes too heavy. It's our responsibility. Would also have paid for 5 year olds, but didn't let them talk to you. Our little one just doesn't get it. Last week we played somewhere else and he's not allowed here.

(Original)
Gerade da gewesen. Unser 4 j√§hriger Sohn durfte nicht spielen. Bahnen zu schwer. Ist doch unsere Verantwortung. H√§tten auch f√ºr 5 j√§hrigen bezahlt, aber lie√üen nicht mit sich reden. Unser Kleiner versteht es gerade nicht. Letzt Woche haben wir woanders gespielt und hier darf er nicht.","(Translated by Google) Very unfriendly employees the shop was empty for more than 30 minutes needed for fries and after asking how long it will take she was very rude to my son and answered...I still have more to do.! As I said, it was empty, the only thing she did with friendliness: talk to my husband... but the worst thing for me was watching how she didn't give the football back to children after it accidentally flew over the fence
After 20 minutes the children came and asked very nicely and she didn't give them back, sadly! so we won't be back

Sehr unfreundliche Mitarbeitern der Laden war leer √ºber 30 min f√ºr Pommes gebraucht und nach fragen wie lange es noch dauern wird war sie meinem Sohn gegen√ºber sehr pampig und antworte...ich habe noch mehr zu tun .! Wie gesagt es war leer das einzige was sie mit Freundlichkeit tat : sich mit meinem Mann  unterhalten ...das schlimmste war aber f√ºr mich zusehen wie sie Kindern den Fu√üball nicht mehr zur√ºck gegeben hat nachdem der ausversehen √ºber den Zaun Flog
Nach 20 min kamen die Kinder und fragten ganz nett und sie hat den nicht zur√ºck gegeben traurig !!! also wir kommen nicht wieder","(Translated by Google) You can only advise against this golf course!!!! It is simply calculated money for children who have not played at all and when asked to clarify it, you learn that the boss is NOT INTERESTED in a clarification. FALSE CLAIMS and RIP-OFFS are common here. There are enough reputable miniature golf courses where you can play. So dear ones don't go there. :) lg

(Original)
Von dieser Golfanlage kann man nur abraten!!!! Es wird einfach Geld f√ºr Kinder berechnet die garnicht gespielt haben und auf Anfrage es zu kl√§ren, erf√§hrt man das sie Chefin NICHT INTERESSIERT ist an einer Kl√§rung. FALSCHE BEHAUPTUNGEN und ABZOCKE sind hier Gang und gebe. ES gibt genug seri√∂se Minigolfanlagen wo man spielen kann. Also ihr lieben geht dort nicht hin. :) lg"
