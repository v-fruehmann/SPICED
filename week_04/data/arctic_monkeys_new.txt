i just wanted to be one of the strokes
now look at the mess you made me make
hitchhiking with a monogrammed suitcase
miles away from any half-useful imaginary highway
i'm a big name in deep space
ask your mates but golden boy's in bad shape
i found out the hard way
that here ain't no place for dolls like you and me
everybody's on a barge
floating down the endless stream of great tv
1984, 2019

maybe i was a little too wild in the 70s
rocket-ship grease down the cracks of my knuckles
karate bandana
warp speed chic
hair down to there
impressive moustache
love came in a bottle with a twist off cap
let's all have a swig and do a hot lap

so who you gonna call?
the martini police
baby, that isn't how they look tonight, oh no
it took the light forever to get to your eyes

i just wanted to be one of those ghosts
you thought that you could forget
and then i haunt you via the rear view mirror
on a long drive from the back seat
but it's alright 'cause you love me
and you recognize that it ain't how it should be
your eyes are heavy and the weather's getting ugly
so pull over, i know the place
don't you know an apparition is a cheap date?
what exactly is it you've been drinking these days?
jukebox in the corner
long hot summer
they've got a film up on the wall and it's dark enough to dance
what do you mean you've never seen blade runner?

oh, maybe i was a little too wild in the 70s
back down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer
elevator down to my make believe residency
from the honeymoon suite
two shows a day, four nights a week
easy money

so who you gonna call?
the martini police
so who you gonna call?

baby, that isn't how they look tonight

last night when my psyche's
subcommittee sang to me in its scary voice
you slowly dropped your eyelids
when true love takes a grip it leaves you without a choice

and in response to what you whispered in my ear
i must admit sometimes i fantasize about you, too

the leader of the free world
reminds you of a wrestler wearing tight golden trunks
he's got himself a theme tune
they play it for him as he makes his way to the ring

and in response to what you whispered in my ear
i must admit sometimes i fantasize about you, too

in the daytime
bendable figures with a fresh new pack of lies
summat else to publicise
i'm sure you've heard about enough

so in response to what you whispered in my ear
i'll be upfront, sometimes (sometimes) i fantasize about you, too

take it easy for a little while

that you say we're all grandfathered in
i'll use the search engine (we've got much to discuss)
too much to discuss
over a bucket of balls
i can recall the glow of your low beams
it's the big night in tinsel city
life became a spectator sport
i launch my fragrance called "integrity"
i sell the fact that i can't be bought
have i told you all about the time

i will flashback now and again but i'm usually alright
thankfully the process has been simplified

i'll be by the batphone if you need to get a hold

still got pictures of friends on the wall
i suppose we aren't really friends anymore
maybe i shouldn't ever have called
that thing friendly at all
get freaked out from a knock at the door
when i haven't been expecting one
didn't that used to be part of the fun, once upon a time?
we'll be there at the back of the bar
in a booth like we usually were
every time there was a rocket launch
or some big event

what a death i died writing that song
start to finish, with you looking on
it stays between us, steinway and his sons
'cause it's the ultracheese
perhaps it's time that you went for a walk
and dress like a fictional character
from a place they called america
in the golden age
trust the politics to come along
when you were just trying to orbit the sun
when you were just about to be kind to someone
because you had the chance

i've still got pictures of friends on the wall
i might look as if i'm deep in thought
but the truth is i'm probably not
if i ever was

oh, the dawn won't stop weighing a tonne
i've done some things that i shouldn't have done
but i haven't stopped loving you once
i just wanted to be one of the strokes
now look at the mess you made me make
hitchhiking with a monogrammed suitcase
miles away from any half-useful imaginary highway
i'm a big name in deep space
ask your mates but golden boy's in bad shape
i found out the hard way
that here ain't no place for dolls like you and me

when i haven't been expecting one
didn't that used to be part of the fun, once upon a time?
we'll be there at the back of the bar
in a booth like we usually were
every time there was a rocket launch
or some big event

what a death i died writing that song
start to finish, with you looking on
it stays between us, steinway and his sons
'cause it's the ultracheese
perhaps it's time that you went for a walk
and dress like a fictional character
from a place they called america
in the golden age
trust the politics to come along
when you were just trying to orbit the sun
when you were just about to be kind to someone
because you had the chance

i've still got pictures of friends on the wall
i might look as if i'm deep in thought
but the truth is i'm probably not
if i ever was

oh, the dawn won't stop weighing a tonne
i've done some things that i shouldn't have done
but i haven't stopped loving you once
have you got color in your cheeks'
do you ever get the feeling that you can't shift the tide
that sticks around like something's in your teeth
and some aces up your sleeve
i had no idea that you're in deep
i dreamt about you near me every night this week
how many secrets can you keep'
'cause there's this tune i found that makes me think of you somehow
when i play it on repeat
until i fall asleep
spilling drinks on my settee

(do i wanna know?)
if this feeling flows both ways
(sad to see you go)
was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(baby we both know)
that the nights were mainly made for saying
things that you can't say tomorrow day

crawlin' back to you.

ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'cause i always do
maybe i'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
now i've thought it through

crawling back to you

so have you got the guts?
been wondering if your heart's still open and
if so i wanna know what time it shuts
simmer down and pucker up
i'm sorry to interrupt it's just i'm constantly
on the cusp of trying to kiss you
i don't know if you feel the same as i do
but we could be together, if you wanted to

i'm a puppet on a string
tracy island, time-traveling diamond
could a shaped heartaches
come to find ya fall in some velvet morning

years too late
she's a silver lining lone ranger riding
through an open space
in my mind when she's not right there beside me

i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself
all i wanna hear her say is are you mine?

are you mine?
are you mine?
are you mine?

i guess what i'm trying to say is i need the deep end
keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
great escape lost track of time and space
she's a silver lining climbing on my desire

and i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself
all i wanna hear her say is are you mine?

are you mine?
are you mine?
are you mine?

and the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
so in case i'm mistaken
i just wanna hear you say you got me baby
are you mine?

she's a silver lining lone ranger riding through an open space
in my mind when she's not right there beside me
and i go crazy cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory

and i can't help myself
all i wanna hear her say is are you mine?
well are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
are you mine? (or just mine tonight?)
are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
(or just mine tonight?)
one for the road, ooh ooh
one for the road, ooh ooh

from the bottom of your heart
the relegation zone
i saw this coming from the start
the shake, rattle and roll
the cracks in blackout blinds
cast patterns on the ceiling but you're feeling fine
i thought it was dark outside
i thought it was dark outside

so we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me round baby, i feel like i've been in here before
i've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
will you pour me one for the road?

i knew this would be on the cards
i knew you wouldn't fold
i saw this coming from the start
the shake, rattle and roll

one for the road, ooh ooh

so we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me round baby, i feel like i've been in here before
i've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
will you pour me one for the road?

the mixture hits you hard
don't get that sinking feeling, don't fall apart
some out of tune guitar
soundtrack to disaster

ooh ooh, one for the road
ooh ooh, one for the road
ooh ooh, one for the road
ooh ooh, one for the road

so we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me round baby, i feel like i've been in here before
i've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
will you pour me one for the road?
arabella's got some interstellar-gator skin boots
and a helter skelter 'round her little finger and i ride it endlessly
she's got a barbarella silver swimsuit
and when she needs to shelter from reality she takes a dip in my daydreams

my days end best when this sunset gets itself
behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side
it's much less picturesque without her catching the light
the horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

as arabella
as arabella
just might have tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure

arabella's got a seventies head
but she's a modern lover
it's an exploration, she's made of outer space
and her lips are like the galaxy's edge
and her kiss the colour of a constellation falling into place

that's magic in a cheetah print coat
just a slip underneath it i hope
asking if i can have one of those
organic cigarettes that she smokes
wraps her lips round the mexican coke
makes you wish that you were the bottle
takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like…

just might have tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure
blind faith
heartache
mind games
mistakes
my sweet fireball
my sweet rigmarole
i want it all
i want it all

old dogs
new tricks
can you feel it?
space age country girl
stone cold miracle
i want it all
i want it all

and then suddenly it hit me it's a year ago
since i drank miniature whiskey and we shared your coke
ain't it just like you to kiss me and then hit the road
leave me listening to the stones
2000 light years from home

shoo-wop, shoo-wop
shoo-wop, shoo-wop
shoo-wop, shoo-wop

shoo-wop, shoo-wop

so you're on the prowl wondering whether she left already or not
leather jacket collar popped like antenna, never knowing when to stop
sunglasses indoors par for the course, lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
cages and poles

call off the search for your soul or put it on hold again
she's having a sly indoor smoke,
she calls the folks who run this her oldest friends,
sipping her drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
as all the signals are sent
her eyes invite you to approach
and it seems as though those lumps in your throat
that you just swallowed have got you going
come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on
number one party anthem

she's a certified mind blower knowing full well that i don't
i may suggest there's somewhere from which i might know her
just to get the ball to roll
drunken monologues, confused because
it's not like i'm falling in love i just want you to do me no good
and you look like you could

come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on
number one party anthem
come on, come on, come on
before the moment's gone
number one party anthem

the look of love
the rush of blood
the "she's with me"
the gallic shrug
the shutterbugs
the camera plus
the black and white and the colour dodge
the good time girls
the cubicles
the house of fun
the number one party anthem

mad sounds in your ears, they make you feel alright
they bring you back to life
mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
they make you get up
yeah they make you get up

love buckles under the strain of those wild nights
run but you cannot hide
mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
they make you get up
all night long they reappear
they make you get up and dance
yeah they make you get up

suppose you've gotta do what you gotta do
we just weren't feeling how we wanted to
you sit and try sometimes but you just can't figure out what went wrong
then out of nowhere somebody comes and hits you with an
ooh la la la, ooh la la la
ooh la la la ooh
ooh la la la, ooh la la la
ooh la la la ooh

you got those mad sounds in your ears to make you get up and dance
mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
they make you get up
i can't explain but i want to try
there's this image of you and i
and it goes dancing by in the morning and in the night time

there's all these secrets that i can't keep
like in my heart there's that hotel suite and you lived there so long,
it's kinda strange now you're gone

i'm not sure if i should show you what i've found
has it gone for good?
or is it coming back around?
isn't it hard to make up your mind?
when you're losing and your fuse is fireside

there's all those places we used to go
and i suspect you already know
but that place on memory lane you liked still looks the same
but something about it's changed

i'm not sure if i should show you what i've found
has it gone for good?
or is it coming back around?
isn't it hard to make up your mind?
when you're losing and your fuse is fireside

and i thought i was yours forever
maybe i was mistaken but i just cannot manage to make it through the day
without thinking of you lately

i'm not sure if i should show you what i've found
has it gone for good?
or is it coming back around?
isn't it hard to make up your mind?
when you're losing and your fuse is fireside
the mirror's image
it tells me it's home time
but i'm not finished
'cause you're not by my side

and as i arrived i thought i saw you leaving
carrying your shoes
decided that once again i was just dreaming
of bumping into you

now it's three in the morning
and i'm trying to change your mind
left you multiple missed calls
and to my message you reply
why'd you only call me when you're high?
high
why'd you only call me when you're high?

somewhere darker
talking the same shite
i need a partner
well are you out tonight?

it's harder and harder to get you to listen
more i get through the gears
incapable of making alright decisions
and having bad ideas

now it's three in the morning
and i'm trying to change your mind
left you multiple missed calls
and to my message you reply
(message you reply)
why'd you only call me when you're high?
(why'd you only call me when you're)
high
why'd you only call me when you're high?

and i can't see you here when i'm high
sort of feels like i'm running out of time
i haven't found all i was hoping to find
you said you got to be up in the morning
gonna have an early night
and you starting to bore me, baby
why'd you only call me when you're high?

why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?

why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
what's been happening in your world?
what have you been up to?
i heard that you fell in love
or near enough
i gotta tell you the truth…

i wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
i get the feeling i left it too late, but baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
if that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
i'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
snap out of it

forever isn't for everyone
is forever for you?
it sounds like settling down or giving up
but it don't sound much like you girl

i wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
i get the feeling i left it too late, but baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
if that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing

under a spell you're hypnotized
darling how could you be so blind?

you got the lights on in the afternoon
and the nights are drawn out long
and you're kissing to cut through the gloom
with a cough drop coloured tongue
and you were sitting in the corner with the coats all piled high
and i thought you might be mine
in a small world on an exceptionally rainy tuesday night
in the right place and time

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks

well you cured my january blues
yeah you made it all alright
i got a feeling i might have lit the very fuse
that you were trying not to light
you were a stranger in my phonebook i was acting like i knew
'cause i had nothing to lose
when the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't coming true
ain't it funny what you'll do

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks

the late afternoon
the ghost in your room that you always thought didn't approve of you knocking boots
never stopped you letting me get hold of the sweet spot by the scruff of your
knee socks

you and me could have been a team
each had a half of a king and queen seat
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby

i wanna be your vacuum cleaner
breathing in your dust
i wanna be your ford cortina
i will never rust
if you like your coffee hot
let me be your coffee pot
you call the shots babe
i just wanna be yours

secrets i have held in my heart
are harder to hide than i thought
maybe i just wanna be yours
i wanna be yours, i wanna be yours
wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours

let me be your 'leccy meter and i'll never run out
and let me be the portable heater that you'll get cold without
i wanna be your setting lotion (i wanna be)
hold your hair in deep devotion (how deep?)
at least as deep as the pacific ocean
i wanna be yours

secrets i have held in my heart
are harder to hide than i thought
maybe i just wanna be yours
i wanna be yours, i wanna be yours
wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours
wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours

i wanna be your vacuum cleaner
breathing in your dust
i wanna be your ford cortina
i will never rust
i just wanna be yours (wanna be yours)
i just wanna be yours (wanna be yours)
i just wanna be yours (wanna be yours)

have you got color in your cheeks'
do you ever get the feeling that you can't shift the tide
that sticks around like something's in your teeth
and some aces up your sleeve
i had no idea that you're in deep
i dreamt about you near me every night this week
how many secrets can you keep'
'cause there's this tune i found that makes me think of you somehow
when i play it on repeat
until i fall asleep
spilling drinks on my settee

(do i wanna know?)
if this feeling flows both ways
(sad to see you go)
was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(baby we both know)
that the nights were mainly made for saying
things that you can't say tomorrow day

crawlin' back to you.

ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'cause i always do
maybe i'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
now i've thought it through

crawling back to you

so have you got the guts?
been wondering if your heart's still open and
if so i wanna know what time it shuts
simmer down and pucker up
i'm sorry to interrupt it's just i'm constantly
on the cusp of trying to kiss you
i don't know if you feel the same as i do
but we could be together, if you wanted to

i'm a puppet on a string
tracy island, time-traveling diamond
could a shaped heartaches
come to find ya fall in some velvet morning

years too late
she's a silver lining lone ranger riding
through an open space
in my mind when she's not right there beside me

i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself
all i wanna hear her say is are you mine?

are you mine?
are you mine?
are you mine?

i guess what i'm trying to say is i need the deep end
keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
great escape lost track of time and space
she's a silver lining climbing on my desire

and i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself
all i wanna hear her say is are you mine?

are you mine?
are you mine?
are you mine?

and the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
so in case i'm mistaken
i just wanna hear you say you got me baby
are you mine?

one for the road, ooh ooh
one for the road, ooh ooh

from the bottom of your heart
the relegation zone
i saw this coming from the start
the shake, rattle and roll
the cracks in blackout blinds
cast patterns on the ceiling but you're feeling fine
i thought it was dark outside
i thought it was dark outside

so we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me round baby, i feel like i've been in here before
i've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
will you pour me one for the road?

i knew this would be on the cards
i knew you wouldn't fold
i saw this coming from the start
the shake, rattle and roll

so we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me round baby, i feel like i've been in here before
i've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
will you pour me one for the road?

the mixture hits you hard
don't get that sinking feeling, don't fall apart
some out of tune guitar
soundtrack to disaster

ooh ooh, one for the road
ooh ooh, one for the road
ooh ooh, one for the road

arabella's got some interstellar-gator skin boots
and a helter skelter 'round her little finger and i ride it endlessly
she's got a barbarella silver swimsuit
and when she needs to shelter from reality she takes a dip in my daydreams

my days end best when this sunset gets itself
behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side
it's much less picturesque without her catching the light
the horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

as arabella
as arabella
just might have tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure

arabella's got a seventies head
but she's a modern lover
it's an exploration, she's made of outer space
and her lips are like the galaxy's edge
and her kiss the colour of a constellation falling into place

just might have tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure

that's magic in a cheetah print coat
just a slip underneath it i hope
asking if i can have one of those
organic cigarettes that she smokes
wraps her lips round the mexican coke
makes you wish that you were the bottle
takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like…

just might have tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure
blind faith
heartache
mind games
mistakes
my sweet fireball
my sweet rigmarole
i want it all
i want it all

old dogs
new tricks
can you feel it?
space age country girl
stone cold miracle
i want it all
i want it all

and then suddenly it hit me it's a year ago
since i drank miniature whiskey and we shared your coke
ain't it just like you to kiss me and then hit the road
leave me listening to the stones
2000 light years from home

shoo-wop, shoo-wop
shoo-wop, shoo-wop
shoo-wop, shoo-wop

shoo-wop, shoo-wop
shoo-wop, shoo-wop

i want it all
i want it all
i want it all
i want it all
so you're on the prowl wondering whether she left already or not
leather jacket collar popped like antenna, never knowing when to stop
sunglasses indoors par for the course, lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
cages and poles

call off the search for your soul or put it on hold again
she's having a sly indoor smoke,
she calls the folks who run this her oldest friends,
sipping her drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
as all the signals are sent
her eyes invite you to approach
and it seems as though those lumps in your throat
that you just swallowed have got you going
come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on
number one party anthem

she's a certified mind blower knowing full well that i don't
i may suggest there's somewhere from which i might know her
just to get the ball to roll
drunken monologues, confused because
it's not like i'm falling in love i just want you to do me no good
and you look like you could

come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on
number one party anthem
come on, come on, come on
before the moment's gone
number one party anthem

the look of love
the rush of blood
the "she's with me"
the gallic shrug
the shutterbugs
the camera plus
the black and white and the colour dodge
the good time girls
the cubicles
the house of fun
the number one party anthem

come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on
before the moment's gone
number one party anthem
number one party anthem
number one party anthem
mad sounds in your ears, they make you feel alright
they bring you back to life
mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
they make you get up
yeah they make you get up

love buckles under the strain of those wild nights
run but you cannot hide
mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
they make you get up
all night long they reappear
they make you get up and dance
yeah they make you get up

suppose you've gotta do what you gotta do
we just weren't feeling how we wanted to
you sit and try sometimes but you just can't figure out what went wrong
then out of nowhere somebody comes and hits you with an
ooh la la la, ooh la la la
ooh la la la ooh
ooh la la la, ooh la la la
ooh la la la ooh

you got those mad sounds in your ears to make you get up and dance
mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
they make you get up
i can't explain but i want to try
there's this image of you and i
and it goes dancing by in the morning and in the night time

there's all these secrets that i can't keep
like in my heart there's that hotel suite and you lived there so long,
it's kinda strange now you're gone

i'm not sure if i should show you what i've found
has it gone for good?
or is it coming back around?
isn't it hard to make up your mind?
when you're losing and your fuse is fireside

there's all those places we used to go
and i suspect you already know
but that place on memory lane you liked still looks the same
but something about it's changed

i'm not sure if i should show you what i've found
has it gone for good?
or is it coming back around?
isn't it hard to make up your mind?
when you're losing and your fuse is fireside

and i thought i was yours forever
maybe i was mistaken but i just cannot manage to make it through the day
without thinking of you lately

i'm not sure if i should show you what i've found
has it gone for good?
or is it coming back around?
isn't it hard to make up your mind?
when you're losing and your fuse is fireside
the mirror's image
it tells me it's home time
but i'm not finished
'cause you're not by my side

and as i arrived i thought i saw you leaving
carrying your shoes
decided that once again i was just dreaming
of bumping into you

now it's three in the morning
and i'm trying to change your mind
left you multiple missed calls
and to my message you reply
why'd you only call me when you're high?
high
why'd you only call me when you're high?

somewhere darker
talking the same shite
i need a partner
well are you out tonight?

it's harder and harder to get you to listen
more i get through the gears
incapable of making alright decisions
and having bad ideas

now it's three in the morning
and i'm trying to change your mind
left you multiple missed calls
and to my message you reply
(message you reply)
why'd you only call me when you're high?
(why'd you only call me when you're)
high
why'd you only call me when you're high?

and i can't see you here when i'm high
sort of feels like i'm running out of time
i haven't found all i was hoping to find
you said you got to be up in the morning
gonna have an early night
and you starting to bore me, baby
why'd you only call me when you're high?

why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?

why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
what's been happening in your world?
what have you been up to?
i heard that you fell in love
or near enough
i gotta tell you the truth…

i wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
i get the feeling i left it too late, but baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
if that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
i'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
snap out of it

forever isn't for everyone
is forever for you?
it sounds like settling down or giving up
but it don't sound much like you girl

i wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
i get the feeling i left it too late, but baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
if that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
i'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
snap out of it

under a spell you're hypnotized
darling how could you be so blind?
(snap out of it)

you got the lights on in the afternoon
and the nights are drawn out long
and you're kissing to cut through the gloom
with a cough drop coloured tongue
and you were sitting in the corner with the coats all piled high
and i thought you might be mine
in a small world on an exceptionally rainy tuesday night
in the right place and time

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks

well you cured my january blues
yeah you made it all alright
i got a feeling i might have lit the very fuse
that you were trying not to light
you were a stranger in my phonebook i was acting like i knew
'cause i had nothing to lose
when the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't coming true
ain't it funny what you'll do

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks

the late afternoon
the ghost in your room that you always thought didn't approve of you knocking boots
never stopped you letting me get hold of the sweet spot by the scruff of your
knee socks

you and me could have been a team
each had a half of a king and queen seat
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby

mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
they make you get up
yeah they make you get up

love buckles under the strain of those wild nights
run but you cannot hide
mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
they make you get up
all night long they reappear
they make you get up and dance
yeah they make you get up

suppose you've gotta do what you gotta do
we just weren't feeling how we wanted to
you sit and try sometimes but you just can't figure out what went wrong
then out of nowhere somebody comes and hits you with an
ooh la la la, ooh la la la
ooh la la la ooh
ooh la la la, ooh la la la
ooh la la la ooh

you got those mad sounds in your ears to make you get up and dance
mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
they make you get up
i can't explain but i want to try
there's this image of you and i
and it goes dancing by in the morning and in the night time

there's all these secrets that i can't keep
like in my heart there's that hotel suite and you lived there so long,
it's kinda strange now you're gone

i'm not sure if i should show you what i've found
has it gone for good?
or is it coming back around?
isn't it hard to make up your mind?
when you're losing and your fuse is fireside

there's all those places we used to go
and i suspect you already know
but that place on memory lane you liked still looks the same
but something about it's changed

i'm not sure if i should show you what i've found
has it gone for good?
or is it coming back around?
isn't it hard to make up your mind?
when you're losing and your fuse is fireside

and i thought i was yours forever
maybe i was mistaken but i just cannot manage to make it through the day
without thinking of you lately

i'm not sure if i should show you what i've found
has it gone for good?
or is it coming back around?
isn't it hard to make up your mind?
when you're losing and your fuse is fireside
the mirror's image
it tells me it's home time
but i'm not finished
'cause you're not by my side

and as i arrived i thought i saw you leaving
carrying your shoes
decided that once again i was just dreaming
of bumping into you

now it's three in the morning
and i'm trying to change your mind
left you multiple missed calls
and to my message you reply
why'd you only call me when you're high?
high
why'd you only call me when you're high?

somewhere darker
talking the same shite
i need a partner
well are you out tonight?

it's harder and harder to get you to listen
more i get through the gears
incapable of making alright decisions
and having bad ideas

now it's three in the morning
and i'm trying to change your mind
left you multiple missed calls
and to my message you reply
(message you reply)
why'd you only call me when you're high?
(why'd you only call me when you're)
high
why'd you only call me when you're high?

and i can't see you here when i'm high
sort of feels like i'm running out of time
i haven't found all i was hoping to find
you said you got to be up in the morning
gonna have an early night
and you starting to bore me, baby
why'd you only call me when you're high?

why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?

why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
what's been happening in your world?
what have you been up to?
i heard that you fell in love
or near enough
i gotta tell you the truth…

i wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
i get the feeling i left it too late, but baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
if that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
i'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
snap out of it

forever isn't for everyone
is forever for you?
it sounds like settling down or giving up
but it don't sound much like you girl

i wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
i get the feeling i left it too late, but baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
if that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
i'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
snap out of it

under a spell you're hypnotized
darling how could you be so blind?
(snap out of it)

you got the lights on in the afternoon
and the nights are drawn out long
and you're kissing to cut through the gloom
with a cough drop coloured tongue
and you were sitting in the corner with the coats all piled high
and i thought you might be mine
in a small world on an exceptionally rainy tuesday night
in the right place and time

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks

well you cured my january blues
yeah you made it all alright
i got a feeling i might have lit the very fuse
that you were trying not to light
you were a stranger in my phonebook i was acting like i knew
'cause i had nothing to lose
when the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't coming true
ain't it funny what you'll do

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks

the late afternoon
the ghost in your room that you always thought didn't approve of you knocking boots
never stopped you letting me get hold of the sweet spot by the scruff of your
knee socks

you and me could have been a team
each had a half of a king and queen seat
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby

well the times are so a'changing
baby even when it's live
you can press pause and rewind

you knew it would go amazing
but is this what you had in mind?
oh there's nothing you can't find

it's two thousand and thirteen
all across the galaxy
it's two thousand and thirteen
(yeah)

on the back of a transmitter
there's a little shiny fruit
and it's coming after you

as for instagram and twitter
she got caught in both lassoes
and neither one will cut her loose

it's two thousand and thirteen
all across the galaxy
it's two thousand and thirteen
(yeah) yeah

so baby take a walk with me
past flying cars and time machines
there's magic like you won't believe, no

it's two thousand and thirteen
all across the galaxy
it's two thousand and thirteen
all across the galaxy
open sesame. (we've places to go)
we've people to see. (let's put 'em on hold)
there's all sorts of shapes, that i bet you can make
when you want to escape say the word

well i know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
with the exception of you i dislike everyone in the room
and i don't wanna lie, but i don't wanna tell you the truth
get the sense that you're on the move
and you'll probably be leaving soon, so i'm telling you

stop the world 'cause i wanna, get off, with you
stop the world 'cause i wanna, get off, with you.

eyes the colour of, (water left in mud)
icing sugar dust. (crazy green flashes)
it's a funny thing, that i cannot explain
don't you know the train keeps a-rolling?

stop the world cause i wanna, get off, with you
stop the world cause i wanna, get off, with you.

well i know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
and i don't wanna lie, and i don't wanna tell you the truth
and i know we got places to go, we got people to see
think we both oughta put 'em on hold and i know you agree

stop the world 'cause i wanna, get off, with you
stop the world 'cause i wanna, get off, with you.
have you got color in your cheeks'
do you ever get the feeling that you can't shift the tide
that sticks around like something's in your teeth
and some aces up your sleeve
i had no idea that you're in deep
i dreamt about you near me every night this week
how many secrets can you keep'
'cause there's this tune i found that makes me think of you somehow
when i play it on repeat
until i fall asleep
spilling drinks on my settee

(do i wanna know?)
if this feeling flows both ways
(sad to see you go)
was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(baby we both know)
that the nights were mainly made for saying
things that you can't say tomorrow day

crawlin' back to you.

ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'cause i always do
maybe i'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
now i've thought it through

crawling back to you

so have you got the guts?
been wondering if your heart's still open and
if so i wanna know what time it shuts
simmer down and pucker up
i'm sorry to interrupt it's just i'm constantly
on the cusp of trying to kiss you
i don't know if you feel the same as i do
but we could be together, if you wanted to

(do i wanna know?)
if this feeling flows both ways
(sad to see you go)

(do i wanna know)
do you want me crawling back to you?
one for the road, ooh ooh
one for the road, ooh ooh

from the bottom of your heart
the relegation zone
i saw this coming from the start
the shake, rattle and roll
the cracks in blackout blinds
cast patterns on the ceiling but you're feeling fine
i thought it was dark outside
i thought it was dark outside

so we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me round baby, i feel like i've been in here before
i've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go
will you pour me one for the road?

i knew this would be on the cards
i knew you wouldn't fold
i saw this coming from the start
the shake, rattle and roll

one for the road, ooh ooh

so we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me round baby, i feel like i've been in here before
i've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go
will you pour me one for the road?

the mixture hits you hard
don't get that sinking feeling, don't fall apart
some out of tune guitar
soundtrack to disaster

ooh ooh, one for the road
ooh ooh, one for the road
ooh ooh, one for the road
ooh ooh, one for the road

so we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor

and your murder of crows

at the cemetary gates

cause you're so dark, babe
but i want you hard

i saw your driving your prius
and even that was munster koach-esque
you watch italian horror and you listen to the scores
leather-clad and spike collar
i want you down on all fours

cause you're so dark, babe
but i want you hard
you're so dark, babe

i know you're nothing like mine
cause she's walking on sunshine
and your love would tear us apart
and i know i'm not your type
cause i don't shun the daylight
but baby i'm willing to start

you're so dark

got your h.p. lovecraft
your edgar allen poe

lately i've been seeing things
belly button piercings in the sky at night
when we're side by side
and i don't mean to rain on anybody's cabaret
one of those games you're gonna lose
but you wanna play it just in case

and now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
more like black treacle than tar
black treacle
somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
and so they found a place to hide

does it help you stay up late?
does it help you concentrate?
is it true you win when you chew your chin?
am i ruining your fun?
and you talk the talk alright
do you walk the walk or catch the train?
you wanted it, you got it
but you don't want it now

now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
more like black treacle than tar
black treacle
somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
and so they found a place to hide

and now i'm out of place and i'm not getting any wiser
i feel like the sundance kid behind a synthesizer
and i tried last night to pack away a laugh
like a key under the mat
but it never seems to be there when you want it

black treacle
black treacle
black treacle
your love is like a studded leather headlock
your kiss, it put could creases in the rain

i'm a puppet on a string
tracy island, time-traveling diamond
could a shaped heartaches
come to find ya fall in some velvet morning

years too late
she's a silver lining lone ranger riding
through an open space
in my mind when she's not right there beside me

i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself
all i wanna hear her say is are you mine?

are you mine?
are you mine?
are you mine?

i guess what i'm trying to say is i need the deep end
keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
great escape lost track of time and space
she's a silver lining climbing on my desire

and i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself
all i wanna hear her say is are you mine?

are you mine?
are you mine?
are you mine?

and the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
so in case i'm mistaken
i just wanna hear you say you got me baby
are you mine?

she's a silver lining lone ranger riding through an open space
in my mind when she's not right there beside me
and i go crazy cause here isn't where i wanna be

well are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
are you mine? (or just mine tonight?)
are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)

she came and substituted
the peace and quiet
for acrobatic blood 
flow constanting her?
her cheating heartbeat
rapid fire

she's thunderstorms
lying on her front
up against the wall
she's thunderstorms

hear who's your host
sounds as if she's pretty close
when the heat starts growing horns
she's thunderstorms

she's been loop-the-looping
around my mind
her motorcycle boots
give me this kind of
acrobatic blood?
constanting her?
cheating heartbeat
rapid fire

she's thunderstorms
lying on her front
up against the wall
she's thunderstorms
in an unusual place
when you're feeling far away
she does what the night does to the day

she's thunderstorms
lying on her front
up against the wall
she's thunderstorms
thunderstorms
thunderstorms
lately i've been seeing things
belly button piercings in the sky at night
when we're side by side
and i don't mean to rain on anybody's cabaret
one of those games you're gonna lose
but you wanna play it just in case

and now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
more like black treacle than tar
black treacle
somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
and so they found a place to hide

does it help you stay up late?
does it help you concentrate?
is it true you win when you chew your chin?
am i ruining your fun?
and you talk the talk alright
do you walk the walk or catch the train?
you wanted it, you got it
but you don't want it now

now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
more like black treacle than tar
black treacle
somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
and so they found a place to hide

and now i'm out of place and i'm not getting any wiser
i feel like the sundance kid behind a synthesizer
and i tried last night to pack away a laugh
like a key under the mat
but it never seems to be there when you want it

black treacle
black treacle
black treacle
you've never met before
but still she greets you like a long lost rock and roll
she's definitely one of those
where you go wherever she goes

oh my body and my mind
both start talking at the exact same time
try'na think of ways to make her mine
but they're difficult to find

it's not what i need
no, your love's not what i need
so don't give it to me

and she said: 'oh, well i knew this will sound cold
but i really have to go
oh it's not that i'm not free
there's nowhere i need to be
it's just your love's not what i need
so don't give it to me'

it's not what i need
no, your love's not what i need
so don't give it to me

she said: i baby i can never leave you
how can i believe you when you can't believe your luck
no point sticking to the plan when it's going slow

it's more a hunger than a thirst
you'll break it out the second time
before you know about the first
looks well-equipped to leave you in the lurch
but you'll let her do her worst

and it's not hard to tell
it's obvious the other angels faces fell
when she told them that she had to go
traded her wings and overcoat for something colorful

(tha knows)
i want to build you up (brick by brick)
i want to break you down (brick by brick)
i'm going to reconstruct (brick by brick)
i want to feel you love

brick by brick (ah)
brick by brick (ah)

i want to steal your soul (brick by brick)
i want to rock 'n' roll (brick by brick)
i want to rock and roll (brick by brick)
i want to rock and roll

brick by brick (ah)
brick by brick (ah)

i want a brick by brick (brick by brick)
i wanna blow wide berth (brick by brick)
i wanna melt this soul (brick by brick)
i wanna brick by brick, by brick, by

brick by brick (ah)
brick by brick (ah)
brick by brick (ah)
brick by brick (ah)
just when things are getting complicated in the eye of the storm
she flicks a red-hot revelation off the tip of her tongue
it does a dozen somersaults and it leaves you supercharged
makes me wanna blow her candles out just to see if you glow in the dark

shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
shalalala

home sweet home, home sweet home, home sweet booby-trap
i took the batteries out my mysticism and put 'em in my thinking cap
she's got a telescopic hallelujah hanging up on the wall
for when it gets too complicated in the eye of the storm

shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
shalalala

oh, and in a hellcat spangled cavern
when your judgment's on the run
and you're acting like a stranger
'cause you thought it looked like fun

well did you ever get the feeling
did you think she set the fall
her steady hands may well have done the devil's pedicure
what you waiting for to sing another fuckin'

shalalala
shalalala
shalalala

library pictures of the quickening canoe
the first of it's kind to get to the moon
draw some ellipses to chase you round the room
through curly straws and metaphors and goo

been watching all the neon blossom, flickering
you look as if you've all forgotten, where you've been
going riding through the thunder circle, fuzz canyon
ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one

library pictures of the quickening canoe
the first of it's kind to get to the moon
give me an eeny-meeny-miny-moe
or an ipp dipp, dog-shit rock and roll
caricatures of your wrecking ball 
in my mind all the time
i wanna be in that damsel-patterned alley
where you go for a smoke

and sorrow slow dances
the phones are lining up 
taking no chances
close but never close enough

been watching cowboy films
on gloomy afternoons
tinting the solitude
put on your dancing shoes
and show me what to do
i know you've got the moves

all my own stunts
hiding has changed its tune 
linking arms, syncing hearts

and sorrow slow dances
around the edges of her eyes
taking no chances
the last one out to win a prize

been watching cowboy films
on gloomy afternoons
tinting the solitude
put on your dancing shoes
and show me what to do
i know you've got the moves
topless models
doing semaphore
wave their flags as she walks by
and get ignored

illuminations
on a rainy day
when she walks her footsteps sing
a reckless serenade

i've been trying to figure out exactly what it is i need
call up to listen to the voice of reason
and got the answering machine

the type of kisses
where teeth collide
when she laughs the heavens hum a stun gun lullaby

those twinkling vixens
with a shining spiral eyes
their hypnosis goes unnoticed when she's walking by

i've been trying to figure out exactly what it is i need
call up to listen to the voice of reason
and got his answering machine

i left my message but did he forget back to me
and now i'm stuck here wondering
how it's meant to be

singing a reckless serenade
reckless serenade
reckless serenade
reckless serenade

reckless serenade
reckless serenade
reckless serenade
i etched a face of a stopwatch
on the back of a raindrop
and did a swap for the sand in an hourglass

i heard an unhappy ending
it sort of sounds like you leaving
i heard the piledriver waltz
it woke me up this morning

you look like you've been for breakfast
at the heartbreak hotel
and sat in the back booth
by the pamphlets and the literature
on how to lose
your waitress was miserable
and so was your food
if you're gonna try and walk on water
make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

mystery's flashing amber
go green when you answer
but the red on the rest of the questionnaire
never changes

i heard the news that you're planning
to shoot me out of a cannon
i heard the piledriver waltz
it woke me up this morning

you look like you've been for breakfast
at the heartbreak hotel
and sat in the back booth
by the pamphlets and the literature
on how to lose
your waitress was miserable
and so was your food
if you're gonna try and walk on water
make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

oh, piledriver
do you still feel younger than you thought you would by now
or, darling, have you started feeling old yet
don't worry, i'm sure that you're still breaking hearts
with the efficiency that only youth can harness
and do you still think love is a laserquest
or do you take it all more seriously
i've tried to ask you this in some daydreams that i've had
but you're always busy being make-believe
and do you look into the mirror to remind yourself you're there
or have somebody's good-night kisses got that covered
well i'm not being honest, i'll pretend that you were just some lover

now i can't think of air without thinking of you
i doubt that comes as a surprise
and i can't think of anything to dream about
i can't find anywhere to hide
and when i'm hanging on by the rings around my eyes
and i convince myself i need another
and for a minute it gets easier to pretend that you were just some lover

when i'm pipe and slippers and rocking chair
singing dreadful songs about something
well i've found a better method of pretending you were just some lover
well i've found a better method of pretending you were just some lover
a pussyfooting setting sun
make a wish that weighs a ton
there are no handles for you to hold
and no understanding where it goes

jealously in technicolor
fear by name, love by numbers
street lamp amber, wanderlust
hide her in a blunderbus

she looks as if she's blowing at kiss at me
and suddenly the sky is a scissor
sitting on the floor with a tambourine
crushing up a bundle of love
don't take it so personally
you're not the only one
that time has got it in for honey
that's where you're wrong

all the old flames fastened on
make a wish that weighs a ton
there are no handles that you can hold
and no understanding where it goes

she looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me
and suddenly the sky is a scissor
sitting on the floor with a tambourine
crushing up a bundle of love
don't take it so personally
you're not the only one,
that time has got it in for honey

that's where you're wrong
that's where you're wrong
that's where you're wrong
ladies, you're damn right
you can't read a man's mind
we're living in two tribes
and heading for war
well, nobody's perfect
we all gotta work it
but fellas, we're worth it
so don't break the law

your call's late, big mistake
you gotta hang about in limbo for as long as i take
next time, read my mind
and i'll be good to you
we're gift-wrapped kitty kats,
we're only turning into tigers when we gotta fight back
let's go, eskimo
out into the blue....

come take my hand, understand that you can,
you're my man & i need you tonight

come make my dreams
honey, hard as it seems
loving me is as easy as pie (aii)

i'm just a love machine
feeding my fantasy
give me a kiss or three & i'm fine
i need a squeeze a day
'stead of this negligee
what will the neighbours say this time

i've been going crazy while you sleep
searching for a language that the 2 of us can speak
so, mr. prehistoric make your wheel
& i'll breathe underwater 'cause i like the way it feels

your call's late, big mistake
you gotta hang about in limbo for as long as i take

(oh) a little education
(oh) to give you motivation

if you can summon the strength, tow me
i can't hold down the urgency
you've got to make your descent slowly
and oil up those sticky keys

coax me out my low
and have a spin of my propeller

it's a necessary evil
no cause for emergency
borrowed the beak of a bald eagle
oh, momentary synergy

coax me out my low

been trying to think of something colorful for this season
pull the wool over the gullible for no reason
you are all i have these days, shake it up and run away
with the night squabbling behind you

from the smoke in your hair to the blood in the bruise
and the bows on the shoes you kicked off
i'm joining the dots
i'm joining the dots

i thought i heard them talking in their sleep yesterday
and i tried but i just can't believe a word they say
hurry up they'll be here soon, sleeping in the afternoon
while the rain's trying to prove a point outside

from the smoke in your hair to the blood in the bruise
and the bows on the shoes you kicked off
i'm joining the dots, i'm joining the dots
i'm joining the dots

those people make me calm, calm the flame
come up to the moth for a change
darling if it's all the same to you, i'll have you to myself
i'm joining the dots, i'm joining the dots
made me kiss ya' with a whisper
and violently you swung, through unfamiliar tongue
couldn't listen to tradition, grabbed me by the wrist to silently insist

and when i'm in the confines of crawling walls, you hold me in place
the ripples on the ceiling the avenues, unsugared taste
waste away the evening, the afternoon, the afternoon's hat
together we'll find something to direct some laughter at

you stood shirtless and confident
listenin' to the fools, tickling the rules
their obsessions follow patterns
sat upon their stools, with their attitudes

and when i'm in the confines of crawling walls, you hold me in place
the ripples on the ceiling the avenues, unsugared taste
waste away the evening, the afternoon, the afternoon's hat
together we'll find something to direct some laughter at

in the painted faces congregate
in the mating season
the seconds homes
they go alone
in no rush leave 'em
and there's a fountain
and a scimitar
shaped yellow light
and it picks you up
and cuts you down to size

the people there
and the furniture
start to seem important
a moment more
and you catch the floor
with a vivid and absorbent sharpened arc
like the scimitar
shaped yellow light
that picks you up
and cuts you down to size

oh i had questions for the tap dancer
sat on my lap
and she had child proof caps on her answers
stone blower blow me a stone
and show me that handsome enchancer
she had a rock on her throttle
and a brown glass bottle full of
shavings from the sun
although those shoes affect your step
don't forget whose legs you're on

there's a fountain and a scimitar
shaped yellow light
and it picks you up
and it cuts you down to size
so who's that girl there? 
i wonder what went wrong
so that she had to roam the streets
she don't do major credit cards
i doubt she does receipts
it's all not quite legitimate
and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes, yeah
that he's got a driving ban
amongst some other offences

and i've seen him with girls of the night
he told roxanne to put on her red light
they're all infected but he'll be alright
'cause he's a scumbag, don't you know
i said he's a scumbag, don't you know! 

although you're trying not to listen
i bet your eyes are staring at the ground
she makes a subtle proposition
i'm sorry love i'll have to turn you down

and oh he must be up to something
want half a chance to show he's more than likely
i've got a feeling in my stomach
i start to wonder what his story might be
what his story might be

they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here
around, here

and look here comes a ford mondeo
isn't he mister inconspicuous
and he don't have to say 'owt
she's in the stance ready to get picked up

and she's delighted when she sees him
pulling in and giving her the eye
because she must be fucking freezing
scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
and don't stop in the winter no and

they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here

they said it changes when the sun goes down
over the river going out of town
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here
around here

and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes that he's got a nasty plan
i hope you're not involved at all
he sank into their calculations
and snorted on the stench
of their arithmetic.
looked for the boy who was hanging his head low,
more trophies than ideas. to follow their pretence.

with a scowl in his pocket and a smile on his face
he followed with obidience
and fell in the nettles.

afterwards those spikey whispers said he bought his own rope.
and skipped the bits they loathed.
didn't scramble to find a dock leaf to capture back our hope
to advice his mind had closed
he lost all of his footholes.

he was a toothpick!
and the garlic and the cinder upon the path
had failed to blunt or hinder the slow collapse
clinging to the doorframe he was dragged
off to a reminder of where he had been.

with a smile in his pocket
and a scowl on his face
he had nowhere to flee
so sat content in the nettles.
so up rolls a riot van
and sparks excitement in the boys
but the policemen look annoyed
perhaps these are ones they should avoid

got chased last night
from men with truncheons dressed in hats
we didn't do that much wrong
still ran away though for the laugh
just for the laugh
and please just stop talking cause they won't find us if you do
oh those silly boys in blue
well they won't catch me and you

have you been drinking son, you don't look old enough to me
i'm sorry officer, is there a certain age you're supposed to be, cause nobody told me

and up rolls the riot van
and these lads just wind the coppers up
they ask why they don't catch proper crooks
they get their address and their names took
but they couldn't care less

thrown in a riot van
and all the coppers kicked him in
and there was no way he could win
just had to take it on the chin
anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus yeah regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen
the lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
of course it's fancy dress
and they're all looking quite forlorn in bunny ears and devil horns and how

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus yeah regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen
i wanna see you take the jackpot out the fruit machine
and put it all back in
you've got to understand that you can never beat the bandit, no

and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
when she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
and there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
and all that is said is that you've drank a lot

and you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind yeah
you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind

and you can pour your heart out
for a reason it would block
oh you send her after nine o' clock

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but

you should bear that in mind tonight

and you can pour your heart out
around three o' clock
when the two-for-ones have done the writer's block
well, it's ever so funny
'cause i don't think you're special, i don't think you're cool
you're just probably alright
but under these lights you look beautiful
and i'm struggling, i can't see through your fake tan
yeah, and you know it for a fact that everybody's eating out of your hands

but what do you know?
oh, you know nothing
yeah, but i'll still take you home
oh, yeah, i'll still take you home
so what do you know?
said, you don't know nothing

well, fancy seeing you in here
you're all tarted up and you don't look the same
well, i haven't seen you since last year
yeah, and surprisingly you have forgotten my name
but you know it, yeah, and you knew it all along
oh and you say you have forgotten
but you're fibbing, go on, tell me i'm wrong

so what do you know?
oh, you know nothing
yeah, but i'll still take you home
oh, yeah, i'll still take you home
so what do you know?
oh, you don't know nothing, no

oh-woah, woah, woah
oh-woah, woah, woah
da-da, da-da-da, da-da, da-da
da-da, da-da, da-da-da
oh-woah, woah, woah

oh, so what do you know?
yeah, you don't know nothing, no
yeah, but i'd still take you home
oh, yeah, i'll still take you home
i said, what do you know?
oh, you don't know nothing

i fancy you with a passion
oh, you're a topshop princess, a rockstar, too
but you're a fad and you're a fashion
and i'm having a job trying to talk to you
but it's alright, yeah, i'll put it on one side
oh, 'cause everybody's looking, you've got control of everyone's eyes
including mine

i've seen your eyes as they fix on me
what is he doing?
what on earth's the plan, has he got one?
you better give me some pointers
since you are the big rocket launcher
and i'm just the shotgun
well, i ain't got no dollar signs in my eyes
that might be a surprise but it's true
said, i'm not like you
and i don't want your advice or your praise
or to move in the ways you do
and i never will

'cause all you people are vampires
and all your stories are stale
and though you pretend to stand by us
i know you're certain we'll fail

well, i've seen your eyes as they fix on me
full of confusion
your snarl is just so condescending
try to explain that we're on to a win
if the fee we got in
near recoups what we're spending
he said, "i can't believe that you drove all that way
well, how much did they pay ya? how much did they pay ya?
you'd have been better to stay round our way"
thinking 'bout things but not actually doing the things

'cause all you people are vampires
and all your stories are stale
and though you pretend to stand by us
i know you're certain we'll fail

'cause all you people are vampires
and all your stories are stale
and though you pretend to stand by us
i know you're certain we'll fail

all you people are vampires
get on your dancing shoes
there's one thing on your mind
hoping they're looking for you
sure you'll be rummaging through

oh and the shit, shock, the horror
you've seen your future bride
yeah, but it's oh so absurd
for you to say the first word
so you're waiting and waiting and

the only reason that you came
so what you scared for
oh, don't you always do the same
it's what you there for, don't you know

the lights are flashing
down in here tonight
and some might exchange a glance
but keep pretending to dance

don't act like it's not happening
as if it's impolite
to go and mention your name
instead you'll just do the same
as they all do, and hope for the best

the only reason that you came
so what you scared for
well don't you always do the same
it's what you're there for but no

get on your dancing shoes
you sexy little swine
hoping they're looking for you
sure you'll be rummaging through

and i said the shit, shock, horror
you've seen your future bride, yeah
yeah, but it's oh so absurd
for you to say the first word
so you're waiting and waiting
stop making the eyes at me
i'll stop making the eyes at you
what it is that surprises me
is that i don't really want you to

and your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
your name isn't rio, but i don't care for sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
well, from 1984

i wish you'd stop ignoring me
because you're sending me to despair
without a sound, yeah, you're calling me
and i don't think it's very fair

that your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
your name isn't rio, but i don't care for sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
well, from 1984

oh, there ain't no love, no montagues or capulets
just banging tunes and dj sets and
dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness

well, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
said, from 1984
said, who's that girl there? 
i wonder what went wrong
so that she had to roam the streets
she don't do major credit cards
i doubt she does receipts
it's all not quite legitimate

and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes, yeah
that he's got a driving ban
amongst some other offences

and i've seen him with girls of the night
and he told roxanne to put on her red light
they're all infected but he'll be alright
'cause he's a scumbag, don't you know?
i said, he's a scumbag, don't you know?

although you're trying not to listen
avert your eyes and staring at the ground
she makes a subtle proposition
"i'm sorry, love, i'll have to turn you down"
and oh, he must be up to summat
what are the chances? sure it's more than likely
i've got a feeling in my stomach
and start to wonder what his story might be
what his story might be, yeah

'cause they said it changes when the sun goes down
yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here, around here, oh

and look here comes a ford mondeo
isn't he mister inconspicuous?
and he don't have to say 'owt
she's in the stance ready to get picked up
bet she's delighted when she sees him
pulling in and giving her the eye
because she must be fucking freezing
scantily-clad beneath the clear night sky
and don't stop in the winter, no

and they said it changes when the sun goes down
yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here

well, they said it changes when the sun goes down
over the river, going out of town
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here, around here, oh

and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes, yeah, that he's got a nasty plan
i hope you're not involved at all
well, oh, they might wear classic reeboks
or knackered converse
or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
but all of that's what the point is not
the point's that there ain't no romance around there

and there's the truth that they can't see
they'd probably like to throw a punch at me
and if you could only see 'em, then you would agree
agree that there ain't no romance around there

you know, oh, it's a funny thing you know
we'll tell 'em if you like
we'll tell 'em all tonight
they'll never listen
because their minds are made up
and course it's all okay to carry on that way

'cause over there, there's broken bones
there's only music, so that there's new ringtones
and it don't take no sherlock holmes
to see it's a little different around here

don't get me wrong, though, there's boys in bands
and kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
and just 'cause he's had a couple o' cans
he thinks it's all right to act like a dickhead

don't you know, oh' it's a funny thing you know
we'll tell 'em if you like
we'll tell 'em all tonight
they'll never listen
because their minds are made up
and course it's all okay to carry on that way

but i said no
oh no
well, you won't get me to go
not anywhere, not anywhere
no, i won't go
oh no no

well, over there, there's friends of mine
what can i say? i've known 'em for a long long time
and, yeah, they might overstep the line
but you just cannot get angry in the same way
no, not in the same way
said, not in the same way
oh no, oh no no
so who's that girl there? 
i wonder what went wrong
so that she had to roam the streets
she don't do major credit cards
i doubt she does receipts
it's all not quite legitimate
and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes, yeah
that he's got a driving ban
amongst some other offences

and i've seen him with girls of the night
he told roxanne to put on her red light
they're all infected but he'll be alright
'cause he's a scumbag, don't you know
i said he's a scumbag, don't you know! 

although you're trying not to listen
i bet your eyes are staring at the ground
she makes a subtle proposition
i'm sorry love i'll have to turn you down

and oh he must be up to something
want half a chance to show he's more than likely
i've got a feeling in my stomach
i start to wonder what his story might be
what his story might be

they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here
around, here

and look here comes a ford mondeo
isn't he mister inconspicuous
and he don't have to say 'owt
she's in the stance ready to get picked up

and she's delighted when she sees him
pulling in and giving her the eye
because she must be fucking freezing
scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
and don't stop in the winter no and

they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here

they said it changes when the sun goes down
over the river going out of town
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here
around here

and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes that he's got a nasty plan
i hope you're not involved at all
he sank into their calculations
and snorted on the stench
of their arithmetic.
looked for the boy who was hanging his head low,
more trophies than ideas. to follow their pretence.

with a scowl in his pocket and a smile on his face
he followed with obidience
and fell in the nettles.

afterwards those spikey whispers said he bought his own rope.
and skipped the bits they loathed.
didn't scramble to find a dock leaf to capture back our hope
to advice his mind had closed
he lost all of his footholes.

he was a toothpick!
and the garlic and the cinder upon the path
had failed to blunt or hinder the slow collapse
clinging to the doorframe he was dragged
off to a reminder of where he had been.

with a smile in his pocket
and a scowl on his face
he had nowhere to flee
so sat content in the nettles.
i thought i saw you in the battleship
but it was only a look a like
she was nothing but a vision trick
under the warning light
she was close, close enough to be your ghost
but my chances turned to toast
when i asked her if i could call her your name

i thought i saw you in the rusty hook
huddled up in wicker chair
i wandered up for a closer look
and kissed who ever was sitting there

she was close, and she held me very tightly
'til i asked awfully politely, please
can i call you her name

and i elongated my lift home,
yeah i let him go the long way round
i smelt your scent on the seat belt
and kept my shortcuts to myself

i thought i saw you in the parrots beak
messing with the smoke alarm
it was too loud for me to hear her speak
and she had a broken arm

it was close, so close that the walls were wet
and she wrote it out in letraset
no you can't call me her name

tell me where's your hiding place
i'm worried i'll forget your face
and i've asked everyone
i'm beginning to think i imagined you all along

i elongated my lift home
yeah i let him go the long way 'round
i smelt your scent on the seat belt
and kept my shortcuts to myself

i saw your sister in the cornerstone
on the phone to the middle man
when i saw that she was on her own
i thought she might understand

she was close, well you couldn't get much closer
she said i'm really not supposed to but yes,
you can call me anything you want
both sides, in softly came the growl from both sides
and if his whisper splits the mist, just think of what he's capable of with his kiss
nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
turned your legs to little building blocks, and with his index finger flicks you on your socks

i go high pitched, he'll talk and make your voice sound high pitched
dread to think if he got you on your own, and whispered in your ear in that baritone
it's the same stone, his heart was cut out of the same stone
that they used to carve his jaw, its impossible not to feel inferior

and he could catapult you back to your daddy or into any hissing misery
and he will tell you how the day after a triumph feels as hollow after the day of tragedy
he'll extinguish any chance of escape when he slaps you on your arse or kisses your nape 
and he's leaving without saying bye

and you will queue up to listen to him pissin'
and hang around to watch some poor girl blub
and then they chase him down the avenue incessantly pestering him to let 'em join the club
he knows how to put a cork in the fuss and just how to shut up, the charming ones of us 
and i've seen him, talking to your lady friend 

there's a dust track waiting for betrayal 
where he'll teach you all the bits they've missed

nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
you cannot turn away
you thrive on dancing in our laps
before the more familiar chaps
and oh the curtain leads to fever

we watched a womaniser cry
and in the last sip you and i
declared we might require a breather

i am the truth true through and i
can feign excitement fluently
as solid as i can busk shock

with well presented merriment
and i know all too well
i shouldn't break the key off in the lock

and the tumble splits the frame, revealing silk and fit
in the fright lined dining room
throw a gaze towards them while they feast

the days drag their heels when you're not there to crack the whip
and the weeks wait to burst like a sache of brass

the old pantomime villian follows my coat
and he hides where it hangs and he spies through the slots

and meanwhile in the desert's only costume shop
the cowls hang and wait to rot away the identities of the willing

drowned bags of sugar in the night
rocketing shuttered doors despite
the shop not opening for hours

you can itch, flap, and whistle
and try to avoid the talk
as i scribbled over drivel you were snoring, showing off

the tumble splits the frame, revealing silk and fit
in the fright lined dining room
throw a gaze towards them while they feast
been fighting with my sheets
and nearly crying in my sleep
yes, i'm battling that well taught gripe
the most restraining type
you should have racing stripes

the way you keep me in pursuit
sharpen the heel of your boot
and you press it to my chest and you make me wheeze
then to my knees you do promote me

i'm pinned down by the dark
a-n-i-m-a-l
makes my head pirouette
more than i won't be willing to confess
d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s

the light it fidgets through
the thoughts'll soon revert to you
about as bashful as a tribal dance
the first and final chance
and cause the audience

the frighteners and fiends
divided up into two teams
when the acrobat fell off the beam
she broke everyone's hearts

i'm pinned down by the dark
a-n-i-m-a-l
makes my head pirouette
more than i would be willing to confess
d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s

d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s
the most unsuitable pet
it's been long enough now so let's
make a mess lioness

pinned down by the dark
i'm pinned down by the dark

d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s

fools on parade cavort and carry on 
for waiting eyes 
that you would rather be beside than in front of 
but she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares 

she swam out of tonight's phantasm 
grabbed my hand and made it very clear 
there's absolutely nothing for us here 
it's a magnolia celebration 

to be attempted on a wednesday night 
it's better than to get a reputation 
as a miserable little tyke 
at least that's the conclusion 
she came to in this overture 

the secret door swings behind us 
she's saying nothing 
she's just giggling along 

her arms were folded most indignant 
not looking like she was soon to leave 
i had to squint in order to believe 
and then like a butler pushing on a bookshelf 

i'm unveiling the unexpected 
how she was never gonna look to? 
suddenly embarrassed and corrected 
how could such a creature 
survive in such a habitat 

the secret door swings behind us 
she's saying nothing 
she's just giggling along 
and even if they were to find us 
i wouldn't notice, i'm completely occupied 

at all the fools on parade 
cavort and carry on for waiting eyes

to be hollowed by the stares 
fools on parade 
frolic and f*ck about to make her gaze 
turn to a scribble on a page by a picture 

that holds her options 
but you're daft to think she'd care 

fools on parade

conduct a sing-along
i was biting the time zone, 
and we embellish the banks of our bloodstreams, 
and threw caution to the colorful 
then we fell asleep in the car, 
until the bumps woke me up in your grip 
and the tide took me to your mouth, 
and then swept me back down to your palms 

it's them that put me inside the reminder 
that yours is the only ocean, 
(yours is the only ocean) 
that i wanna swing from, 
yours is the only ocean, 
that i wanna hang on 

i've got this ego mechanic, 
she's always trying to give me vitamins 
oh she'd be frightened of your reflection, 
i preferred her as a cartoon 

if i could be someone else for a week, 
i'd spend it chasing after you, 
'cause she's not shattering my attitude, 
no matter how she folds the potion 

yours is the only ocean, 
that i wanna swing from, 
yours is the only ocean, 
that i wanna hang on to 

i'm swinging on 
yours is the only ocean, 
yours is the only ocean, 
yours is the only ocean, 
yours is the only ocean 

potion approaching, shield your eyes, 
potion approaching, visualize, 
holding a token, swollen in size, 
potion approaching, shield your eyes 

oh but if we're gonna escape though, 
we really ought to think it through, 
would you like me to build you a go kart?

tricking through the morning, 
the tramp with the trampoline under his arm, 
shifts past your whiskers, 
so spark is a charm with the barking alarm, 
weighs coil 'til the corner is turned. 

and the bicycle wheels, all struggle to move round, 
in your muddy mind, 
blatantly cape town, 
and will intertwine in co-operative time, 
shall we sit on the springs 'til the mung goes dry? 

all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms 
and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall, 
all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms 
and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the

what came first the chicken or the dickhead? 
split sleep reeps through rewards and ill fitting thoughts, 
a twilight force, she doesn't wanna walk, 
your legs start running and your head gets caught, 
cannot be nineteen, it's perfectly placed for the reasonably frightening, 
pulled from the after taste, you'll have to slip away, 
and i'm happy to say, 
behold as the crook in a hammock plays

all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms 
and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall, 
all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms 
and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall

behold as the crook in the hammock plays, 
crawling with the base of the scales, 
and fiddles with the feet on a balancing act, 
gagged, bound and craft in a tale, 
trailing wrapped in a gasp, 

crawling with the base of the scales, 
and fucking fiddles with the feet on a balancing act, 
you were gagged, bound and craft in a tale, 
trailing wrapped in a gasp. 

all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms 
and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall,

and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall.
fiendish wonder in the carnival's wake 
though it caresses once again irritate 
tread softly stranger 
move over toward the danger that you seek 

you think excitement has receded 
and the mirror distracts 
the logic of the trance 
quickly reaches and grasps 
handsome and faceless 
and weightless, your imagination roams 

and now it's no ones fault but yours 
at the foot of the house of cards 
you thought you'd never get obsessed 
you thought the wolves would be impressed 
and you're a sinking stone 
but you know what it's like to hold the jeweler's hand 
that procession of pioneers all drowned 

in the moonlight they're more thrilling 
those things that he knows 
as he leads you through the grinning 
bubble blowers in the snow 
watching his exit 
is like falling off the ferry in the night 

the inevitables gather to push you around 
any old voice makes a punishing sound 
he became laughter's assassin 
shortly after he showed you what it was 

and now it's no ones fault but yours 
at the foot of the house of cards 
you thought you'd never get obsessed 
you thought the wolves would be impressed 
and you're a sinking stone 
but you know what it's like to hold the jeweler's hand 
that procession of pioneers all drowned

when i got back from fixing my hair,
you were directing traffic.
letting your story slip on the snow as
if the transmission was automatic.
it's arguable
that i shouldn't have been there.
it was fortunate timing.
i had a hole in the pocket
of my favorite coat
and my love dropped
into the lining.
(have you got your strange?)
not on me. i haven't got my strange
(have you got your strange?)
not on me
you can't sleep
until you've sat
on the steps to weep
until you feel like
you've wept yeah.
(as long as you don't forget your strange)
(have you got your strange?)
no, not on me. i haven't got my strange
i've better fetch my strange.
i haven't got my strange.
if you can summon the strength, tow me
i can't hold down the urgency
you've got to make your descent slowly
and oil up those sticky keys

coax me out my low
and have a spin of my propeller

it's a necessary evil
no cause for emergency
borrowed the beak of a bald eagle
oh, momentary synergy

coax me out my low
sink into tomorrow
coax me out my low
and have a spin of my propeller

my propeller won't spin and i can't get it started on my own
when are you arriving?
my propeller won't spin and i can't get it started on my own
when are you arriving?
my propeller won't spin and i can't get it started on my own
when are you arriving?

outside the cafe by the cracker factory
you were practicing a magic trick
and my thoughts got rude, as you talked and chewed
on the last of your pick and mix

said your mistaken if your thinking that i haven't been called cold before
as you bit into your strawberry lace
and then a flip in your attention in the form of a gobstopper
is all you have left and it was going to waste

your past-times, consisted of the strange
and twisted and deranged
and i love that little game you had called
crying lightning
and how you like to aggravate the ice-cream man on rainy afternoons

the next time that i caught my own reflection
it was on it's way to meet you
thinking of excuses to postpone
you never look like yourself from the side
but your profile did not hide
the fact you knew i was approaching your throne

with folded arms you occupy the bench like toothache
stood and puff your chest out like you never lost a war
and though i try so not to suffer the indignity of a reaction
there was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

and your past-times, consisted of the strange
and twisted and deranged
and i hate that little game you had called
crying lightning
and how you like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons

uninviting
but not half as impossible as everyone assumes
you are crying lightning

your past-times, consisted of the strange
and twisted and deranged
and i hate that little game you had called
crying lightning
crying lightning
crying lightning
crying lightning

your past-times, consisted of the strange

i thought i saw you in the rusty hook

she was close, and she held me very tightly

yeah i let him go the long way round

outside the cafe by the cracker factory
you were practicing a magic trick
and my thoughts got rude, as you talked and chewed
on the last of your pick and mix

said your mistaken if your thinking that i haven't been called cold before
as you bit into your strawberry lace
and then a flip in your attention in the form of a gobstopper
is all you have left and it was going to waste

your past-times, consisted of the strange
and twisted and deranged
and i love that little game you had called
crying lightning
and how you like to aggravate the ice-cream man on rainy afternoons

the next time that i caught my own reflection
it was on it's way to meet you
thinking of excuses to postpone
you never look like yourself from the side
but your profile did not hide
the fact you knew i was approaching your throne

with folded arms you occupy the bench like toothache
stood and puff your chest out like you never lost a war
and though i try so not to suffer the indignity of a reaction
there was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

and your past-times, consisted of the strange
and twisted and deranged
and i hate that little game you had called
crying lightning
and how you like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons

uninviting
but not half as impossible as everyone assumes
you are crying lightning

your past-times, consisted of the strange
and twisted and deranged
and i hate that little game you had called
crying lightning
crying lightning
crying lightning
crying lightning

your past-times, consisted of the strange
and twisted and deranged
and i hate that little game you had called
crying
been fighting with my sheets
and nearly crying in my sleep
yes, i'm battling that well taught gripe
the most restraining type
you should have racing stripes

the way you keep me in pursuit
sharpen the heel of your boot
and you press it to my chest and you make me wheeze
then to my knees you do promote me

i'm pinned down by the dark
a-n-i-m-a-l
makes my head pirouette
more than i won't be willing to confess
d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s

the light it fidgets through
the thoughts'll soon revert to you
about as bashful as a tribal dance
the first and final chance
and cause the audience

the frighteners and fiends
divided up into two teams
when the acrobat fell off the beam
she broke everyone's hearts

i'm pinned down by the dark
a-n-i-m-a-l
makes my head pirouette
more than i would be willing to confess
d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s

d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s
the most unsuitable pet
it's been long enough now so let's
make a mess lioness

pinned down by the dark
i'm pinned down by the dark

d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s
a-n-i-m-a-l

she swam out of tonight's phantasm 
grabbed my hand and made it very clear 
there's absolutely nothing for us here 
it's a magnolia celebration 

to be attempted on a wednesday night 
it's better than to get a reputation 
as a miserable little tyke 
at least that's the conclusion 
she came to in this overture 

the secret door swings behind us 
she's saying nothing 
she's just giggling along 

her arms were folded most indignant 
not looking like she was soon to leave 
i had to squint in order to believe 
and then like a butler pushing on a bookshelf 

i'm unveiling the unexpected 
how she was never gonna look to? 
suddenly embarrassed and corrected 
how could such a creature 
survive in such a habitat 

the secret door swings behind us 
she's saying nothing 
she's just giggling along

i wouldn't notice, i'm completely occupied

when i got back from fixing my hair,
you were directing traffic.
letting your story slip on the snow as
if the transmission was automatic.
it's arguable
that i shouldn't have been there.
it was fortunate timing.
i had a hole in the pocket
of my favorite coat
and my love dropped
into the lining.
(have you got your strange?)
not on me. i haven't got my strange
(have you got your strange?)
not on me
you can't sleep
until you've sat
on the steps to weep
until you feel like
you've wept yeah.
(as long as you don't forget your strange)
(have you got your strange?)
no, not on me. i haven't got my strange
i've better fetch my strange.
i haven't got my strange.
oh baby, i'm wanting to do you a swap
i'll give you anything, yeah
in return for the noises you've got
and i can see you want to be attended to
just count to twenty-nine and i'll attend to you
oh for sure, well certainly, yeah yeah yeah

wavin' bye to the train or the bus
i'm ever so worried because
i don't want to get all forgotten

so very comfortable
don't really need to put up my feet
and even in fat sam's grand slam
can't see it being easier to speak
when you've karate-kicked your way to someone new
and i'm a memory and don't know what to do
all on his own
collecting his dole n' stuff

wavin' bye to the train or the bus
i'm ever so worried because
i don't want to get all forgotten
'cause we know
yeah, we know-oh-oh-oh
oh we know, a whoa-oh-oh

don't know where we're going, baby
i s'pose it depends
but even if we're all far apart
we can all come back and all be fine
we'll be able to be together again

be together again
be together again
be together again

everybody will be together again
stop making the eyes at me
i'll stop making the eyes at you
what it is that surprises me
is that i don't really want you to

and your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
your name isn't rio, but i don't care for sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor

well, from 1984

i wish you'd stop ignoring me
because you're sending me to despair
without a sound, yeah, you're calling me
and i don't think it's very fair

that your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
your name isn't rio, but i don't care for sand

oh, there ain't no love, no montagues or capulets
just banging tunes and dj sets and
dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness!

so who's that girl there? 
i wonder what went wrong
so that she had to roam the streets
she don't do major credit cards
i doubt she does receipts
it's all not quite legitimate
and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes, yeah
that he's got a driving ban
amongst some other offences

and i've seen him with girls of the night
he told roxanne to put on her red light
they're all infected but he'll be alright
'cause he's a scumbag, don't you know
i said he's a scumbag, don't you know! 

although you're trying not to listen
i bet your eyes are staring at the ground
she makes a subtle proposition
i'm sorry love i'll have to turn you down

and oh he must be up to something
want half a chance to show he's more than likely
i've got a feeling in my stomach
i start to wonder what his story might be
what his story might be

they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here
around, here

and look here comes a ford mondeo
isn't he mister inconspicuous
and he don't have to say 'owt
she's in the stance ready to get picked up

and she's delighted when she sees him
pulling in and giving her the eye
because she must be fucking freezing
scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
and don't stop in the winter no and

they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here

they said it changes when the sun goes down
over the river going out of town
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here
around here

and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes that he's got a nasty plan
i hope you're not involved at all
well, last night these two bouncers
and one of 'em's alright, the other one's the scary one
his way or no way, totalitarian
he's got no time for your looking or breathing
how he don't want you to, so step out the queue
he makes examples of you and there's nowt you can say
behind they go through to the bit where you pay
and you realize then that it's finally the time
to walk back past ten-thousand eyes in the line
and you can swap jumpers and make another move
instilled in your brain, you've got something to prove
to all the smirking faces and the boys in black
why can't they be pleasant? why can't they have a laugh?
he's got his hand in your chest, he wants to give you a duff
well, secretly i think they want you all to kick off
they want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well
it's just something to talk about, a story to tell, yeah

well, i'm so glad they turned us all away
we'll put it down to fate
i said a thousand million things
that i could never say this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

well, this town's a different town today
said, this town's a different town to what it was last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday
and that girl's a different girl today
said, that girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday
of course not

well, i'm so glad they turned us all away
we'll put it down to fate
i thought a thousand million things
that i could never think this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

last night, what we talked about
it made so much sense
but now the haze has ascended
it don't make no sense anymore
said, last night, what we talked about
it made so much sense
but now the haze has ascended
it don't make no sense anymore, oh

da-da, da-da-da
da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da

please don't let the light through my window
keep the curtain shut
it brings me good luck 

please don't let the light through my window
don't want to see the day
i don't need it anyway 

please don't let the light through my window
don't want to see the shop
or the wet bus stop 

please don't let the light through my window
the bells ring out for doom
at this sunday afternoon 

please don't let the light through my window
please don't let the light through my window
diamonds are forever,
they are all i need to please me,
they can stimulate and tease me,
they won't leave in the night,
i've no fear that they might desert me.
diamonds are forever,
hold one up and then caress it,
touch it, stroke it and undress it,
i can see every part,
nothing hides in the heart to hurt me.

i don't need love,
for what good will love do me?
diamonds never lie to me,
for when love's gone,
they'll luster on.

diamonds are forever,
sparkling round my little finger.
unlike men, the diamonds linger;
men are mere mortals who
are not worth going to your grave for.

i don't need love,
for what good will love do me?
diamonds never lie to me,
for when love's gone,
they'll luster on.

diamonds are forever, forever, forever.
diamonds are forever, forever, forever.
forever and ever

she'll be saying, use me

anything we should know about your change? -- oh and the cost to correct a fraud
a fraud
i'm going to go out and kid them
applaud
applaud
if you're the highest bidder, i'm yours

you figure out pathetic sets
we're not sure of the etiquette
we think out pathetic sets
we're not sure of the etiquette

and if you found this it's probably too late
clinically cynical hereditary hate
if you found this it's probably too late
ever so clinical i'm running out of mates

if we concentrate on being off the cuff
not sure we're ready but probably rough
frightening honesty isn't enough
and it's nothing on the early stuff
i don't ever want to hate you
so don't show me your bed
the only roads are cul-de-sacs
the first thing that she said

temptation, greets you like your naughty mate
the one that used to get you in bother
but one you could never bring yourself to hate

and she said we've got that spark
that only lights a fuse
helps you see in the dark
but it's a sight you'll lose when
the temptation greets you like your naughty friend

i don't ever want to hate you
so don't show me your bed
the only roads are cul-de-sacs
the only ends are dead

temptation greets you like your naughty mate
one that made you steal and set things on fire
but one you haven't seen of late

and i said that kind of talk
only adds intrigue
to the cauldron of thought
it's already exceeding
temptation, the very thing that held her back

i don't ever want to hate you
so don't show me your bed
the only roads are cul-de-sacs
the only ends are dead

i don't ever want to hate you
it's not part of the plan
so keep your charm where i can't see it

and your hands where i can

we used to be in tight me and my naughty friends
caused enticement in the air
i mean day 'n' night
we robbed, we stole, we loved to fight
smoking, drinking, joyriding
drugs, thugs, not law-abiding
reckless gangsters, no direction
no sign of correction
but then i switched it off
changed my ways
what the hell
like oh my days
but like my naughty friends
they're not phased
can't believe that this music pays
see no reason why we can't do
all the things we've always done
still in my heart i know that's just what
but its hard to fight the temptation son

the panic will fall down around you
if you don't do what i say

i don't ever want to hate you
so don't show me your bed
the only roads are cul-de-sacs
the only ends are dead

i don't ever want to hate you
it's not part of the plan
so keep your charm where i can't see it
and your hands where i can
betwixt and between the fantasy dream and the fear
do you wonder where she is this afternoon?
and does it get on your nerves, make it slightly perturbed
that there's things that you don't know about her
and even the places that she's never been with you
seem awful empty without her

you can look into those eyes
down no telephone line
what if you were right the first time?

you can look into those eyes
down no telephone line
what if you were right the first time?

betwixt and between the fantasy dream and the fear
do you wonder where she is this afternoon?
and with the needle in groove, is there all to prove
and tell me are your feet still tapping?
i know there's a first for a trip over the water
what is the worst that could happen?

you can look into those eyes
down no telephone line
what if you were right the first time?

despair to the point will they provoke
the punchline before they have told the joke
the sheer desperation to be seen
staring at the television screen

despair to the point where they provoke
you to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke
sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
it wasn't in the top one hundred list

and it's the thousandth time, and it's even bolder
don't be surprised when you get bent over
he told ya that you were dying for it

she saw it, and she grabbed it, and it wasn't what it seemed
the kids all dream of making it, whatever that means
another variation on a theme
a tangle on the television and the magazine
do you reckon that they do it for a joke?
do you reckon that they make 'em take an oath
that says 'we are defenders
of any poseur or professional pretender around

when did your list replace the twist and turn
ah, the fist replaced the kissed-on concern
and if you're bothered, i don't want your prayers
save it for the morning after

and it's the thousandth time, and it's even bolder
don't be surprised when you get bent over
he told ya that you were dying for it

let's have a game on the teddy picker

already thick and you're getting thicker

assuming that all things are equal
who'd want to be men of the people
when there's people like you?
he knew what he wanted to say
but he did not want to word it
the dirty little herbert
was thinking an escape
but the place was well guarded
the guiltiness that started
soon as the other part had stopped

d is for delightful
and try and keep your trousers on
i think you should know you're his favorite worst nightmare

d is for desperately trying to simulate what it was that was all right
three quarters of an hour ago
that led him to be in a position
and every copper mission
on every other episode

he's nearing the brink, but he thinks first
the parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene

running off over next doors garden
before the hour is done
it's more a question of feeling
than it is a question of fun
the confidence is the balaclava
i'm sure you'll baffle 'em good
with the ending wreak of salty cheeks
and runny makeup alone

oh, will blood run down the face
of a boy bewildered and scorned
and you'll find yourself in a skirmish
where you wish you'd never been born
you tie yourself to the tracks
and there isn't no going back
and it's wrong, wrong, wrong
but we'll do it anyway 'cause we love a bit of trouble

are you pulling her from a burning building
or throwing her to the sharks?
can only hope that the ending is a pleasurable as the start
the confidence is the balaclava
i'm sure you baffle 'em straight
and it's wrong, wrong, wrong
she can hardly wait

that's right, he won't let her out his sight
now the shaggers perform
and the daggers are drawn
who's the crooks in this crime?

that's right, he won't let her out his sight
how the shaggers perform
and the daggers are drawn
who's the crooks is this...
crime!

that's right, he won't let her out his sight
that's right, he won't let her out his sight
that's right, he won't let her out his sight

you'll be able to post any day of the most
for the sights of all time

you knew that he'd be trouble right before the very first kiss
quiet and unassuming, but you heard that they were the naughtiest
she pleaded with you to take it off
but you resisted and fought
sorry sweetheart abba drava
keep on the balaclava
you used to get it in your fishnets
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
landed in a very common crisis
everything's in order in a black hole
nothing seems as pretty as the past though
that bloody mary's lacking a tabasco
remember when he used to be a rascal?

oh, that boy's a slag
the best you ever had
the best you ever had
is just a memory and those dreams
not as daft as they seem
not as daft as they seem
my love, when you dream them up

flicking through a little book of sex tips
remember when the boys were all electric?
now, when she tells she's gonna get it
i'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
clinging to not getting sentimental
said, she wasn't going, but she went, still
likes her gentlemen to not be gentle
was it a mega-dobber or a betting pencil?

oh, that boy's a slag
the best you ever had
the best you ever had
is just a memory, and those dreams
weren't as daft as they seem
not as daft as they seem
my love, when you dream them up
oh, where did you go?
where did you go?
where did you go? whoa

you're falling about
you took a left off last laugh lane
you just sounded it out
you're not coming back again

that bloody mary's lacking in tabasco
remember when he used to be a rascal?
in a foreign place the saving grace was the feeling
that it was a heart that he was stealing
oh, he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement
the eyes are bright; he couldn't wait to get away
i bet the juliet was just the icing on the cake
make no mistake, no

and even if somehow you could have shown you the place you wanted

well, i'm sure you could have made it that bit better on your own
and i bet she told a million people that she'd stay in touch
well, all the little promises - they don't mean much
when there's memories to be made
and i hope you're holding hands by new years eve
they made it far too easy to believe
that true romance can't be achieved these days

and even if somehow you could have shown you the place you wanted
well, i sure you could have made it that bit better on your own
you are the only ones who know
well, the morning was complete
where there was tears on the steering wheel, dripping on the seat
several hours or several weeks
i'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak

it's the beginning of the end 
the car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend
ask anyone, they'll tell you that
it's these times that it tends
to start to breaking up, to start to fall apart
hold on to your heart

and do me a favor, will you break my nose
and do me a favor, and tell me to go away
oh, do me a favor, stop asking questions

well she walked away while her shoes were untied 
when the eyes were all red
you could see that we'd cried 
and i watched, and i waited till she was inside
forcing a smile and waving goodbye

curiosity becomes a heavy load
too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
curiosity becomes a heavy load
too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold

and do me a favor, and ask, if you need some help
she said, do me a favor, and stop flattering yourself
and to tear apart the ties that bind
perhaps 'f*ck off' might be too kind
perhaps 'f*ck off' might be too kind
there's a room for the trouble and there's lovers to be had
those ones that make sinners out of such lovely lads

and the last thing they want is for the feeling to end

the more you open your mouth
the more you're forcing performance
all the attention is leading me to feel important (completely obnoxious)
now that we're here, we may as well go too far

wriggling around just so that you won't forget
there's certainly some venom in the looks that you collect
aimlessly gazing at the faces in the queue
struggling with the notion that it's life, not film

if you were there, beware
the serpent soul pinchers
three hundred and fifty no thank-yous, and nobody flinches
go on, girl, go on, give us something gruesome
we require your grief, the thugs help the thieves
as they're trying to rock the words from her gob and
take the source of the innocents

if you were there, beware
the serpent soul pinchers
can't you sense she was never meant
to fill column inches?
and you've had enough, what you're trying to dig up
isn't there to be dug, the thieves help the thugs
as they're trying be the good grace of a sweetheart
out to the point she'll comply

why leave her on her own?
if i'd have known, then i wouldn't have said it
i wouldn't have said it if i would have known
why leave her on her own?
if i predicted tears, then i wouldn't have said it

there's a circle of witches, ambitiously vicious they are
our attempts to remind them of reason won't get us that far

she hasn't got it to give
do the bad thing
take off your wedding ring
but it won't make it that much easier
it might make it worse

oh, the night's like a whirlwind
somebody's girlfriend's talkin' to me, but it's alright
she's sayin' that he's not gonna slap me or try to attack me
he's not the jealous type
and i only need to get half an excuse and i'm away
but when there's no excuses, that's much easier to say
i've been before
and all these capers make her too forward to ignore
well, she's talkin', but i'm not entirely sure, oh

do the bad thing
take off your wedding ring
but it won't make it that much easier
it might make it worse

oh, i'm standing at the bar and somebody's partner's talkin' to me
but i don't know that is what she isn't
she murmurs things to confirm that the tragedy is true
and i knew how she could have anyone she wants
and i'm strugglin' to think of an immediate response

like, i don't mind
be a big mistake
for you to wait
and let me waste your time
really, love, it's fine
really, love, it's fine

and then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy

i knew before the invitation that there was this ploy
oh, but she carried on suggestin' a struggle to refuse
she said, 'it's the red wine this time, but that is no excuse.'
old yellow bricks
love's a risk
quite the little 'escapologist'
looked so miffed
when you wished
for a thousand places better than this

you are the fugitive
but you don't know what you're runnin' from
you can't kid us
and you couldn't trick anyone
houdini, love you don't know what you're runnin' away from

who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
blinded by nostalgia
who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?

she was enraged but the way
that the emperor put traps in the cage
and the days she been dull
lead to nights readin' beer bottles

you're such a fugitive
but you don't know what you're runnin' from
you can't kid us

houdini, love you don't know what you're runnin' away from

who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
blinded by nostalgia
who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?

you're at a loss
just because
it wasn't all that you thought it was

you are a fugitive, but you don't know what you're runnin' away from

she said, "i want to sleep in the city that never wakes up
and revel in nostalgia."
i know i said he wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up, but
dorothy was right though
i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination you're waiting, lying on your side
with your hands between your thighs

stop and wait a sec
oh, when you look at me like that, my darling
what did you expect?
i probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
or i did last time i checked

not shy of a spark
a knife twists at the thought that i should fall short of the mark
frightened by the bite though it's no harsher than the bark
middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination you're waiting, lying on your side
with your hands between your thighs

but i crumble completely when you cry
it seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
i'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
take my hands off of your eyes too soon

i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination you're waiting, lying on your side
with your hands between your thighs and a smile!

you to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke
sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
it wasn't in the top one hundred list

and it's the thousandth time, and it's even bolder
don't be surprised when you get bent over
he told ya that you were dying for it

she saw it, and she grabbed it, and it wasn't what it seemed
the kids all dream of making it, whatever that means
another variation on a theme
a tangle on the television and the magazine
do you reckon that they do it for a joke?
do you reckon that they make 'em take an oath
that says 'we are defenders
of any poseur or professional pretender around

when did your list replace the twist and turn
ah, the fist replaced the kissed-on concern
and if you're bothered, i don't want your prayers
save it for the morning after

and it's the thousandth time, and it's even bolder
don't be surprised when you get bent over

let's have a game on the teddy picker

assuming that all things are equal
who'd want to be men of the people

he knew what he wanted to say
but he did not want to word it
the dirty little herbert
was thinking an escape
but the place was well guarded
the guiltiness that started
soon as the other part had stopped

d is for delightful
and try and keep your trousers on
i think you should know you're his favorite worst nightmare

d is for desperately trying to simulate what it was that was all right
three quarters of an hour ago
that led him to be in a position

running off over next doors garden
before the hour is done
it's more a question of feeling
than it is a question of fun
the confidence is the balaclava
i'm sure you'll baffle 'em good
with the ending wreak of salty cheeks
and runny makeup alone

oh, will blood run down the face
of a boy bewildered and scorned
and you'll find yourself in a skirmish
where you wish you'd never been born
you tie yourself to the tracks
and there isn't no going back
and it's wrong, wrong, wrong
but we'll do it anyway 'cause we love a bit of trouble

are you pulling her from a burning building
or throwing her to the sharks?
can only hope that the ending is a pleasurable as the start
the confidence is the balaclava
i'm sure you baffle 'em straight
and it's wrong, wrong, wrong
she can hardly wait

that's right, he won't let her out his sight
now the shaggers perform
and the daggers are drawn
who's the crooks in this crime?

that's right, he won't let her out his sight

you'll be able to post any day of the most

you knew that he'd be trouble right before the very first kiss
quiet and unassuming, but you heard that they were the naughtiest
she pleaded with you to take it off
but you resisted and fought
sorry sweetheart abba drava
keep on the balaclava
you used to get it in your fishnets
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
landed in a very common crisis
everything's in order in a black hole
nothing seems as pretty as the past though
that bloody mary's lacking a tabasco
remember when he used to be a rascal?

oh, that boy's a slag
the best you ever had
the best you ever had
is just a memory and those dreams
not as daft as they seem
not as daft as they seem
my love, when you dream them up

flicking through a little book of sex tips
remember when the boys were all electric?
now, when she tells she's gonna get it
i'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
clinging to not getting sentimental
said, she wasn't going, but she went, still
likes her gentlemen to not be gentle
was it a mega-dobber or a betting pencil?

the best you ever had

you're falling about
you took a left off last laugh lane
you just sounded it out
you're not coming back again

in a foreign place the saving grace was the feeling
that it was a heart that he was stealing
oh, he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement
the eyes are bright; he couldn't wait to get away
i bet the juliet was just the icing on the cake
make no mistake, no

and even if somehow you could have shown you the place you wanted

well, i'm sure you could have made it that bit better on your own
and i bet she told a million people that she'd stay in touch
well, all the little promises - they don't mean much
when there's memories to be made
and i hope you're holding hands by new years eve
they made it far too easy to believe
that true romance can't be achieved these days

and even if somehow you could have shown you the place you wanted
well, i sure you could have made it that bit better on your own
you are the only ones who know
well, the morning was complete
where there was tears on the steering wheel, dripping on the seat
several hours or several weeks
i'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak

it's the beginning of the end 
the car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend
ask anyone, they'll tell you that
it's these times that it tends
to start to breaking up, to start to fall apart
hold on to your heart

and do me a favor, will you break my nose
and do me a favor, and tell me to go away
oh, do me a favor, stop asking questions

well she walked away while her shoes were untied 
when the eyes were all red
you could see that we'd cried 
and i watched, and i waited till she was inside
forcing a smile and waving goodbye

curiosity becomes a heavy load
too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
curiosity becomes a heavy load
too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold

and do me a favor, and ask, if you need some help
she said, do me a favor, and stop flattering yourself
and to tear apart the ties that bind

the more you open your mouth

all the attention is leading me to feel important (completely obnoxious)
now that we're here, we may as well go too far

wriggling around just so that you won't forget
there's certainly some venom in the looks that you collect
aimlessly gazing at the faces in the queue

if you were there, beware
the serpent soul pinchers
three hundred and fifty no thank-yous, and nobody flinches
go on, girl, go on, give us something gruesome
we require your grief, the thugs help the thieves
as they're trying to rock the words from her gob and
take the source of the innocents

if you were there, beware
the serpent soul pinchers
can't you sense she was never meant
to fill column inches?
and you've had enough, what you're trying to dig up
isn't there to be dug, the thieves help the thugs
as they're trying be the good grace of a sweetheart
out to the point she'll comply

why leave her on her own?

do the bad thing
take off your wedding ring
but it won't make it that much easier
it might make it worse

oh, the night's like a whirlwind
somebody's girlfriend's talkin' to me, but it's alright
she's sayin' that he's not gonna slap me or try to attack me
he's not the jealous type
and i only need to get half an excuse and i'm away
but when there's no excuses, that's much easier to say
i've been before
and all these capers make her too forward to ignore
well, she's talkin', but i'm not entirely sure, oh

do the bad thing
take off your wedding ring
but it won't make it that much easier
it might make it worse

oh, i'm standing at the bar and somebody's partner's talkin' to me
but i don't know that is what she isn't
she murmurs things to confirm that the tragedy is true
and i knew how she could have anyone she wants
and i'm strugglin' to think of an immediate response

like, i don't mind
be a big mistake
for you to wait
and let me waste your time
really, love, it's fine
really, love, it's fine

and then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy

i knew before the invitation that there was this ploy
oh, but she carried on suggestin' a struggle to refuse
she said, 'it's the red wine this time, but that is no excuse.'
old yellow bricks
love's a risk
quite the little 'escapologist'
looked so miffed
when you wished
for a thousand places better than this

you are the fugitive
but you don't know what you're runnin' from
you can't kid us
and you couldn't trick anyone
houdini, love you don't know what you're runnin' away from

who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
blinded by nostalgia
who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?

she was enraged but the way
that the emperor put traps in the cage
and the days she been dull
lead to nights readin' beer bottles

you're such a fugitive
but you don't know what you're runnin' from
you can't kid us
and you couldn't trick anyone
houdini, love you don't know what you're runnin' away from

who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
blinded by nostalgia
who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?

you're at a loss
just because
it wasn't all that you thought it was

you are a fugitive, but you don't know what you're runnin' away from

she said, "i want to sleep in the city that never wakes up
and revel in nostalgia."
i know i said he wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up, but
dorothy was right though
i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination you're waiting, lying on your side
with your hands between your thighs

stop and wait a sec
oh, when you look at me like that, my darling
what did you expect?
i probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
or i did last time i checked

not shy of a spark
a knife twists at the thought that i should fall short of the mark
frightened by the bite though it's no harsher than the bark
middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination you're waiting, lying on your side
with your hands between your thighs

but i crumble completely when you cry
it seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
i'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
take my hands off of your eyes too soon

i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination you're waiting, lying on your side
with your hands between your thighs and a smile!

or at least that's the impression i get
'cause you're smooth, and you're wet
and she's not aware yet
but she's yours

she'll be saying, use me
show me the jacuzzi
i imagine that it's there, on a plate
you're whole rendezvous rate
means that you'll never be frightened
to make them wait for a while
i doubt it's your style
not to get what you set
out to acquire the eyes are on fire
you are the unforecasted storm
hup

calm, collected and commanding
(top marks for not trying)
you leave the other stories standing
with your renditions and jokes

that have wept 'cause you've stolen their

thunder

'cause we can't take our eyes
off the t-shirt and ties combination

well, see you later, innovator

she murmurs things to confirm that the tragedy is true
and i knew how she could have anyone she wants
and i'm strugglin' to think of an immediate response

like, i don't mind
be a big mistake
for you to wait
and let me waste your time
really, love, it's fine
really, love, it's fine

and then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy

i knew before the invitation that there was this ploy
oh, but she carried on suggestin' a struggle to refuse
she said, 'it's the red wine this time, but that is no excuse.'
old yellow bricks
love's a risk
quite the little 'escapologist'
looked so miffed
when you wished
for a thousand places better than this

you are the fugitive
but you don't know what you're runnin' from
you can't kid us
and you couldn't trick anyone
houdini, love you don't know what you're runnin' away from

who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
blinded by nostalgia
who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?

she wasn't raged but the way
that the emperor put traps in the cage
and the days she been dull
lead to nights readin' beer bottles

you're such a fugitive
but you don't know what you're runnin' from
you can't kid us
and you couldn't trick anyone
houdini, love you don't know what you're runnin' away from

who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
blinded by nostalgia
who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?

you're at a loss
just because
it wasn't all that you thought it was

you are a fugitive, but you don't know what you're runnin' away from

she said, "i want to sleep in the city that never wakes up
and revel in nostalgia."
i know i said he wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up, but
dorothy was right though
i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination you're waiting, lying on your side
with your hands between your thighs

stop and wait a sec
oh, when you look at me like that, my darling
what did you expect?
i probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
or i did last time i checked

not shy of a spark
a knife twists at the thought that i should fall short of the mark
frightened by the bite though it's no harsher than the bark
middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination you're waiting, lying on your side
with your hands between your thighs

but i crumble completely when you cry
it seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
i'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
take my hands off of your eyes too soon

i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination you're waiting, lying on your side
with your hands between your thighs and a smile!
you used to get it in your fishnets
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
landed in a very common crisis
everything's in order in a black hole
nothing seems as pretty as the past though
that bloody mary's lacking a tabasco
remember when he used to be a rascal?

oh, that boy's a slag
the best you ever had
the best you ever had
is just a memory and those dreams
not as daft as they seem
not as daft as they seem
my love, when you dream them up

flicking through a little book of sex tips
remember when the boys were all electric?
now, when she tells she's gonna get it
i'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
clinging to not getting sentimental
said, she wasn't going, but she went, still
likes her gentlemen to not be gentle
was it a mega-dobber or a betting pencil?

oh, that boy's a slag
the best you ever had
the best you ever had
is just a memory, and those dreams
weren't as daft as they seem
not as daft as they seem
my love, when you dream them up
oh, where did you go?
where did you go?
where did you go? whoa

falling about
you took a left off last laugh lane
you just sounded it out
you're not coming back again

i wish you would have smiled in the bakery
or sat on a tatty settee
at a mutual friends gathering

and the more you keep on looking
the more it's hard to take
love we're in stalemate
to never meet is surely where we're bound
there's one in every town
just there to grind you down

i wish i would have seen you in the post office
well maybe i did and i missed it
too busy with the mind on clever lines

why not the rounders pitch or the canteen
you're slacking love were have you been?
just have to go and wait until tonight

to give me the invite
don't worry it's alright

i wish i would have seen you down in the arcade
sippin' on a lemonade
in the paper cup and chewin' on a straw

and i wish i would have seen you in the bakery
but if i'd seen you in the bakery
you probably wouldn't have seen me
he looks as if he hasn't slept
his hair is purposely unkept
and then he know his people wept
when you crafted your plan

shadows underneath the eyes
and everywhere the bastard lies
my lack of proof is your disguise
you won't remember me

there's nothing really i can say
but sorry mate and walk away
i could be wrong unless you play your game

this world is full of most unkind
and horrible is redefined
i can't imagine that you'd mind at all

you're lying again, you're conscience in your friend
and the only thing you're sorting out is your imagination
lying again, your conscience in your friend
and the only thing you're sorting out is your imagination

is he really on the street?
desperation or deceit?
and what he's wearing on his feet
won't solve our mystery

and i am baffled by
how you stand there, soaking it in
and do you hide your identity
where you hide your grin? better hide your grin

shadows underneath the eyes
everywhere the bastard lies
my lack of proof is your disguise
you won't remember me

there's nothing really i can say
but sorry mate and walk away
i could be wrong unless you play your game

this world is full of most unkind
and horrible is redefined
i can't imagine that you'd mind at all

you're lying again, your conscience in your friend
and the only thing you're sorting out is your imagination
lying again, conscience in your friend
and the only thing you're sorting out is your imagination

the smiles as she walked in the room
have all turned into frowns am i too quick to assume
that the love is no longer in bloom?
the tantrums and the tears play a very different tune

to what they did before, her heads red raw
and the ending doesn't sound like they're happiest around
when you sobbed before it felt much more like the product of a squabble
now there's reason for it to be something more

and no would be, oh, it's uncertain
whether the curtain has shut for good
she says, "see if it's still raining
i'm not dressed for it and if you loved me"
and i interrupt to receive the scowl and stare
but still decided to stop her there

would it be outrageous to say
we're either shouting or we're shagging?
locked in tempestuous phase
at least that's how we felt yesterday
the eyes are getting heavier and whether you're asleep or awake is a mystery

would a kiss be too much to ask?
when you fit me as sunday's frozen pitch
fits the thermos flask
it's a pity, it just hit me, we can't go back
to the chest touching on the back
meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
you say why did you do it with him today?
and sniff me out like i was tanqueray

'cause you're my fella, my guy
hand me your stella and fly
by the time i'm out the door
you tear me down like roger moore

i cheated myself
like i knew i would
i told ya, i was troubled
you know that i'm no good

upstairs in bed, with my ex boy
he's in the place, but i can't get joy
thinking of you in the final throws,
this is when my buzzer goes

run out to meet your chicks and bitter
you say when we're married cause you're not bitter
there'll be none of him no more
i cried for you on the kitchen floor

i cheated myself
like i knew i would
i told ya, i was troubled
you know that i'm no good

sweet reunion, jamaica and spain
we're like how we were again
i'm in the tub you're on the seat
lick your lips as i soak my feet

then you notice lickle carpet burn
my stomach drops and my guts churn
you shrug and it's the worst
to truly stuck the knife in first

i cheated myself
like i knew i would
i told ya, i was troubled
you know that i'm no good

i cheated myself
like i knew i would
i told ya, i was troubled
you know that i'm no good
stop making the eyes at me
i'll stop making the eyes at you
what it is that surprises me
is that i don't really want you to

and your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
your name isn't rio, but i don't care for sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
well, from 1984

i wish you'd stop ignoring me
because you're sending me to despair
without a sound, yeah, you're calling me
and i don't think it's very fair

that your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)

oh, there ain't no love, no montagues or capulets
just banging tunes and dj sets and
dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness!

there's always somebody taller with more of a wit 
and he's equipped to enthrall her and her friends think he's fit
and you just can't measure up though, you don't have a prayer
wishing that you'd made the most of her when she was there 

they've got engaged, there's no intention of a wedding 
he's pinched your bird and he'd probably kick your head in 

bigger boys and stolen sweethearts 
oh, you're better off without her anyway 
you said you wasn't sad to see her go 
yeah, but i know you were though

now you don't know what she's up to, you can only assume
if she's not in the front of the shops then they've gone to his room
bet she's gone 'round in her school stuff, bet that's what he likes
i know you thought she were different and you thought she were nice

but she's not nice, she's pretty fucking far from nice
she's looking at you funny rarely looking at you twice

bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
oh, you're better off without her anyway
you said you wasn't sad to see her go
yeah, but it's so clear you were though 

have you heard what she's been doing? never did it for me 
he picks her up at the school gates at twenty past three 
she's been with all of the boys but never went very far 
and she wagged english and science just to go in his car 

they've got engaged, there's no intention of a wedding 
he's pinched my bird and he'd probably kick my head in 
oh, now the girls have grown 
yeah, but i'm sure that they still carry on in similar ways 

bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
oh, you're better off without her anyway
you said you wasn't sad to see her go
yeah, but i'm only pretending, you know 
yeah, i'm only pretending, you know 
i was only pretending, you know 
i was only pretending, you know
well, this is a good idea
he wouldn't do it if it wasn't
he wouldn't do it if it wasn't one

well, my friend fancies you
oh, what a way to begin it all
you said they're always exciting words to hear

they woke up together
not quite realizing how
awkwardly stretching and yawning
it's always hard in the morning

and i suppose that's the price you pay
well, oh, it isn't what it was
she's thinking he looks different today
and oh, there's nothing left to guess now

they left before the lights came on
because they didn't want to ruin
what it was that was brewing
before they absolutely had to

and how can you wake up
with someone you don't love?
and not feel slightly phased by it
oh, he had a struggle

they woke up together
not quite realizing how
awkwardly stretching and yawning
it's always hard in the morning

and i suppose that's the price you pay
well, oh, it isn't what it was
she's thinking he looks different today
and oh, there's nothing left to guess now

quick, let's leave
before the lights come on
'cause then you don't have to see
'cause then you don't have to see what you've done

quick, let's leave
before the lights come on
'cause then you don't have to see
'cause then you don't have to see what you've done

i'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
i'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
i'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?

so who's that girl there? 
i wonder what went wrong
so that she had to roam the streets
she don't do major credit cards
i doubt she does receipts
it's all not quite legitimate
and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes, yeah
that he's got a driving ban
amongst some other offences

and i've seen him with girls of the night
he told roxanne to put on her red light
they're all infected but he'll be alright
'cause he's a scumbag, don't you know
i said he's a scumbag, don't you know! 

although you're trying not to listen
i bet your eyes are staring at the ground
she makes a subtle proposition
i'm sorry love i'll have to turn you down

and oh he must be up to something
want half a chance to show he's more than likely
i've got a feeling in my stomach
i start to wonder what his story might be
what his story might be

they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here
around, here

and look here comes a ford mondeo
isn't he mister inconspicuous
and he don't have to say 'owt
she's in the stance ready to get picked up

and she's delighted when she sees him
pulling in and giving her the eye
because she must be fucking freezing
scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
and don't stop in the winter no and

they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here

they said it changes when the sun goes down
over the river going out of town
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here
around here

and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes that he's got a nasty plan
i hope you're not involved at all

echo through the room
more point to a wedding disco
without a bride or groom
there's a super cool band yeah
with their trilbys and their glasses of white wine
and all the weekend rockstars are in the toilets
practicing their lines

i don't want to hear you
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear, you know
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you
i don't want to hear your

fake tales of san francisco
echo through the air
and there's a few bored faces at the back
all wishing they weren't there

and as the microphone squeaks
a young girl's telephone beeps
yeah she's dashing for the exit
oh she's running to the streets outside
"oh you've saved me," she screams down the line
"the band were fucking wank
and i'm not having a nice time"

i don't want to hear you
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear, you know
(kick me out, kick me out)

yeah but his bird said it's amazing, though
so all that's left
is the proof that love's not only blind but deaf

he talks of san francisco, he's from hunter's bar
i don't quite know the distance
but i'm sure that's far
yeah i'm sure it's pretty far

and yeah, i'd love to tell you all my problem
you're not from new york city, you're from rotherham
so get off the bandwagon, and put down the handbook
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get on your dancing shoes
there's one thing on your mind
hoping they're looking for you
sure you'll be rummaging through

and the shit, shock, horror
you've seen your future bride
oh, but it's oh so absurd
for you to say the first word
so you're waiting and waiting

the only reason that you came
so what you scared for
don't you always do the same
it's what you there for, don't you know

the lights are flashing
down in here tonight
and some might exchange a glance
but keep pretending to dance

don't act like it's not happening
as if it's impolite
to go and mention your name
instead you'll just do the same
as they all do, and hope for the best ...

the only reason that you came
so what you scared for
well don't you always do the same
it's what you're there for but no

get on your dancing shoes
you sexy little swine
hoping they're looking for you
sure you'll be rummaging through

oh and the shit, shock, horror
you've seen your future bride
oh, but it's oh so absurd
for you to say the first word
so you're waiting and waiting
one look sends it coursing through the veins oh how the feeling races
back up to their brains to form expressions on there stupid faces
they don't want to say hello
like i want to say hello
oh the heartbeats at its peak when you're coming up to speak

and i'm so tense, never tenser
could all go a bit frank spencer? 
i'm talking gibberish, tip of the tongue but i can't deliver it
properly, oh it's all getting on top of me
and if it weren't this dark you'd see how red my face has gone

everybody's trying to crack the jokes and that to make you smile
those that claim that they're not showing off are drowning in denial
they're not half as bad as me say anything and i'll agree
'cause when it comes to acting up, i'm sure i could write the book

and now that you're more than a part in the play
it's slightly easier to think what to say
you had us all, standing on our heads
doing our best tricks

never again
never again, will there be another one that's as desirable as you

one look sends it coursing through the veins oh how the feeling races
back up to their brains to form expressions on there stupid faces
well, it's ever so funny
'cause i don't think you're special, i don't think you're cool
you're just probably alright
but under these lights you look beautiful
and i'm struggling, i can't see through your fake tan
yeah, and you know it for a fact that everybody's eating out of your hands

but what do you know?
oh, you know nothing
yeah, but i'll still take you home
oh, yeah, i'll still take you home
so what do you know?
said, you don't know nothing

well, fancy seeing you in here
you're all tarted up and you don't look the same
well, i haven't seen you since last year
yeah, and surprisingly you have forgotten my name
but you know it, yeah, and you knew it all along
oh and you say you have forgotten but you're fibbing, go on, tell me i'm wrong

so what do you know?
oh, you know nothing
yeah, but i'll still take you home
oh, yeah, i'll still take you home
so what do you know?
oh, you don't know nothing, no

oh-woah, woah, woah
oh-woah, woah, woah
da-da, da-da-da, da-da, da-da
da-da, da-da, da-da-da
oh-woah, woah, woah

oh, so what do you know?
yeah, you don't know nothing, no
yeah, but i'd still take you home
oh, yeah, i'll still take you home
i said, what do you know?
oh, you don't know nothing

i fancy you with a passion
oh, you're a topshop princess, a rockstar, too
but you're a fad and you're a fashion
and i'm having a job trying to talk to you
but it's alright, yeah, i'll put it on one side
oh, 'cause everybody's looking, you've got control of everyone's eyes including mine
so up rolls a riot van
and sparks excitement in the boys
but the policemen look annoyed
perhaps these are ones they should avoid

got chased last night
from men with truncheons dressed in hats
we didn't do that much wrong
still ran away though for the laugh
just for the laugh
and please just stop talking cause they won't find us if you do
oh those silly boys in blue
well they won't catch me and you

have you been drinking son, you don't look old enough to me
i'm sorry officer, is there a certain age you're supposed to be, cause nobody told me

and up rolls the riot van
and these lads just wind the coppers up
they ask why they don't catch proper crooks
they get their address and their names took
but they couldn't care less

thrown in a riot van
and all the coppers kicked him in
and there was no way he could win
just had to take it on the chin
we'll ask if we can have six in
if not we'll have to have two
well, you're coming up our end, aren't you?
so i'll get one with you
won't he let us have six in?
especially not with the food
he could have just told us no though
he didn't have to be rude

you see her with the green dress?
she talked to me at the bar
wait, how come it's already two pound fifty?
we've only gone about a yard
didn't you see she were gorgeous
she were beyond belief
but this lad at her side drinking his smirnoff ice
came and paid for her tropical reef

and i'm sitting going backwards
and i didn't want to leave
i said, "it's high green, mate
via hillsborough, please"

well, how funny were that sketch earlier
up near that taxi rank?
oh no, you would have missed it
think it were when you went to the bank
these two lads squaring up proper shouting
'bout who were next in the queue
the kind of thing that'd seem so silly
but not when they've both had a few

well calm down, temper, temper
you shouldn't get so annoyed
well, you're acting like a silly little boy
and they wanted to be men
and do some fighting in the street
they said "no surrender
no chance of retreat"

and so why are they in the taxi?
'cause i didn't want to leave
i said, "it's high green, mate
via hillsborough, please"

drunken plots hatched to jump it
ask around, "are you sure?"
went for it but the red light was showing
and red light indicates doors are secured
now then mardy bum
i see your frown
and it's like looking down the barrel of a gun
and it goes off
and out come all these words
oh there's a very pleasant side to you
a side i much prefer
it's one that laughs and jokes around
remember cuddles in the kitchen
yeah, to get things off the ground
and it was up, up and away
oh, but it's right hard to remember
that on a day like today when you're all argumentative
and you've got the face on

well now then mardy bum
oh i'm in trouble again, aren't i
i thought as much
cause you turned over there
pulling that silent disappointment face
the one that i can't bare

can't we laugh and joke around
remember cuddles in the kitchen
yeah, to get things off the ground
and it was up, up and away
oh, but it's right hard to remember
that on a day like today when you're all argumentative
and you've got the face on

yeah i'm sorry i was late
well i missed the train
and then the traffic was a state
and i can't be arsed to carry on in this debate
that reoccurs ,oh when you say i don't care
well of course i do, yeah i clearly do!

so laugh and joke around
remember cuddles in the kitchen
yeah, to get things off the ground
and it was up, up and away
still it's right hard to remember
that on a day like today when you're all argumentative
and you've got the face on
i've seen your eyes as they fix on me
what is he doing
what on earth's the plan, has he got one
you better give me some pointers since you are the big rocket launcher and i'm just the shotgun

well i ain't got no dollar signs in my eyes
that might be a surprise but it's true
i'm not like you and i don't want your advice or your praise or to move in the ways you do
and i never will

'cause all you people are vampires
and all your stories are stale
and though you pretend to stand by us
i know you're certain we'll fail

i've seen your eyes as they fix on me
full of confusion
your snarl is just so condescending
try to explain that we're on to a win
if the fee we got in
near recoups what we're spending

he said
i can't believe that you drove all that way
well how much did they pay you, how much did they pay you?
you'd have been better to stay round our way
thinking about things but not actually doing the things

'cause all you people are vampires
and all your stories are stale
and though you pretend to stand by us
i know you're certain we'll fail

'cause all you people are vampires
and all your stories are stale
and though you pretend to stand by us
i know you're certain we'll fail

all you people are vampires
so who's that girl there? 
i wonder what went wrong
so that she had to roam the streets
she don't do major credit cards
i doubt she does receipts
it's all not quite legitimate
and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes, yeah
that he's got a driving ban
amongst some other offences

and i've seen him with girls of the night
he told roxanne to put on her red light
they're all infected but he'll be alright
'cause he's a scumbag, don't you know
i said he's a scumbag, don't you know! 

although you're trying not to listen
i bet your eyes are staring at the ground
she makes a subtle proposition
i'm sorry love i'll have to turn you down

and oh he must be up to something
want half a chance to show he's more than likely
i've got a feeling in my stomach
i start to wonder what his story might be
what his story might be

they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here
around, here

and look here comes a ford mondeo
isn't he mister inconspicuous
and he don't have to say 'owt
she's in the stance ready to get picked up

and she's delighted when she sees him
pulling in and giving her the eye
because she must be fucking freezing
scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
and don't stop in the winter no and

they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here

they said it changes when the sun goes down
over the river going out of town
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here
around here

and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes that he's got a nasty plan
i hope you're not involved at all
well, last night these two bouncers
and one of 'em's alright, the other one's the scary one
his way or no way, he totalitarian
he's got no time for you looking or breathing
how he don’t want you to, so step out the queue
he makes examples of you and there's nowt you can say
behind they go through to the bit where you pay
and you realise then that it's finally the time
to walk back past ten-thousand eyes in the line
and you can swap jumpers and make another move
instilled in your brain, you've got something to prove
to all the smirking faces and the boys in black
why can't they be pleasant? why can't they have a laugh?
he's got his hand in your chest, he wants to give you a duff
well, secretly i think they want it all to kick off
they want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well
it's just something to talk about, a story to tell, yeah

well, i'm so glad they turned us all away
we'll put it down to fate
i said a thousand million things
that i could never say this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

well, this town's a different town today
said, this town's a different town to what it was last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday
and that girl's a different girl today
said, that girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday, of course not

well, i'm so glad they turned us all away
we'll put it down to fate
i thought a thousand million things
that i could never think this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

last night, what we talked about
it made so much sense
but now the haze has ascended
it don't make no sense anymore
i said, last night, what we talked about
it made so much sense
but now the haze has ascended
it don't make no sense anymore, oh

da-da, da-da-da
da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
well oh they might wear classic reeboks
or knackered converse
or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
but all of that's what the point is not
the point's that there ain't no romance around there

and there's the truth that they can't see
they'd probably like to throw a punch at me
and if you could only see them, then you would agree
agree that there ain't no romance around there

you know, oh it's a funny thing you know
we'll tell 'em if you like
we'll tell 'em all tonight
they'll never listen
because their minds are made up
and 'course it's all okay to carry on that way

and over there, there's broken bones
there's only music, so that there's new ringtones
and it don't take no sherlock holmes
to see it's a little different around here

don't get me wrong, oh there's boys in bands
and kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
and just 'cause he's had a couple o' cans
he thinks it's all right to act like a dickhead

don't you know, oh it's a funny thing you know
we'll tell em if you like
we'll tell em all tonight
they'll never listen
because their minds are made up
and 'course it's all okay to carry on that way

i said no
oh no
oh you won't get me to go
anywhere, said anywhere
i won't go
oh no no

well over there, there's friends of mine
what can i say? i've known 'em for a long long time
and yeah they might overstep the line
but i just cannot get angry in the same way
not in the same way
not in the same way
oh no, oh no no
so who's that girl there? 
i wonder what went wrong
so that she had to roam the streets
she don't do major credit cards
i doubt she does receipts
it's all not quite legitimate
and what a scummy man

well, i wrote my number down. 
i'd never wrote it down before. 
i was gonna bring over like something from a film but 
i didn't have the bottle at all. 

well i had a look and you kept staring. 
your head pairing up with mine 
cos your so pretty and i'm so shy. 
you proper did give me the eye though im sure you did 
well i went outside, couldn't say i tried. 
and i felt regret. 
but in a flash yeah i'd dashed back in. 
cos the ship had'nt sailed yet. 

and when i did i couldn't see your face 
i could see your mates but that wouldn't do. 
i dashed around to find you 
but you were nowhere to be seen 
oh no no 

na na na na na na na na na na na 
na na na na na na na na na na na 
na na na na na na na na na na na 
na na na na na nooooo 

well yeah she flew away. 
she seemed like weeks or months away. 
(missing lines) 

yeah but i learned my lesson though. 
your so pretty and i'm so shy 
anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus yeah regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen
the lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
of course it's fancy dress
and they're all looking quite forlorn in bunny ears and devil horns and how

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus yeah regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen
i wanna see you take the jackpot out the fruit machine
and put it all back in
you've got to understand that you can never beat the bandit, no

and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
when she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
and there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
and all that is said is that you've drank a lot

and you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind yeah
you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind

and you can pour your heart out
for a reason it would block
oh you send her after nine o' clock

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus yeah regardless of what's gone before

and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
when she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
and there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
and all that is said is that you've drank a lot

and you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind yeah
you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind

and you can pour your heart out
around three o' clock
when the two-for-ones have done the writer's block
sat at the side of the pool at one of your houses
with wet white trousers on
and worlds collide as the evening continues, the dignity fucks off
her brother's gone off to the strippers to make up for all the lost time
she could have been one of the bitches but she's actually alright

cigarette smoker, i'm sorry
but we're all unsure how much you've had
but we think that you outta maybe not have anymore

a country home, even if we really tried
would it cease to surprise us now
and i bet your dad would like to give us all a slap
when are your parents back d'ya know?

well, i never came from no ghetto
but it wasn't nowhere near here
well, spoken girls and stilettos
aren't something to fear

cigarette smoker, i'm sorry
but we're all unsure how much you've had
but we think that you outta maybe not have anymore

cigarette smoker, i'm sorry
but we're all unsure how much you've had
but we think that you outta maybe not have anymore

cigarette smoker, cigarette smoke doesn't hide
as well as you think
and you think that it outta act as the perfect disguise

he's pining for her in a people carrier
there might be buildings and pretty things to see like that
but architecture won't do

although it might say a lot about the city or town
i don't care what they've got, keep on turning them down
it don't say the funny things she does
don't even try and cheer him up, because it just won't happen

he's got the feeling again, this time on the aero plane
there might be tellies in the back of the seats in front
but rodney and del won't do

although it might take your mind off the aches and the pains
laugh when he falls through the bar but you're feeling the same
'cause she isn't there to hold your hand
she won't be waiting for you when you land

it feels like she's just nowhere near
you could well be out on your ear
this thought comes closely followed by the fear
and the thoughts of it makes you feel a bit ill

yesterday i saw a girl who looked like someone
you might knock about with
and almost shouted

and then reality kicked in within us
it seems as we become the winners
you lose a bit of summat
and half wonder if you won it at all

and don't say ow 'cause you've got no idea
and she's still nowhere near
and the thought comes closely followed by the fear
and the thoughts of it makes you feel a bit ill

despair in the departure lounge
it's one and they'll still be around at three
no signal and low battery, what's happened to me?
lady where's your love gone?
i was looking but can't find it anywhere
they always offer when there's loads of love around
but when you're short of some it's nowhere to be found

well, i know your game, you told him yesterday
?no chance, you'll get nothing from me?
but now she's there, you're there and everybody's there
and he's in turmoil as puzzled as can be, just like me

let's go down, down low down
where i know i should not go
oh, and she thinks she's the one
but she's just one in twenty-four
and just 'cause everybody's doing it
does that mean that i can too?

lady where's your love gone?
it was the antiseptic to the sore
to hold you by the hand must he first be in demand?
how he longs for you to long for him once more, just once more

let's go down, down low down
where i know i should not go
oh, and she thinks she's the one
but she's just one in twenty-four
and just 'cause everybody's doing it
does that mean that i can too?

her eyes went down and cut you up
and there's nothing like a dirty look from
the one you want or the one you've lost

an ache in your soul it's everybody's goal
to get what they can't have
that's why you're after her and that's why she's after him
but saying it won't change a thing
and now realizing it won't change a thing
realizing it won't change a thing
we all want some one to shout for
yeah, everyone wants somebody to adore
but heroes aren't what they seem
when you've been, where we've been

have i done something to trigger
the funny looks and the sniggers
are they there at all
or is it just paranoia

everybody's got there box
and doing what they're told
you push my faith near being lost
but we'll stick to the guns

don't care if it's marketing suicide
we won't crack or compromise
your derisory divides
will never unhinge us

and there's a couple of hundred
think they're christopher columbus
but the settlers had already settled
here long before you

just because we're having a say so
not lining up to be play-doh
in five years time will it be
who the f*ck's arctic monkeys?

'cause everybody's got there box
and doing what they're told
you push my faith near being lost
but we'll stick to the guns

don't care if it's marketing suicide
we won't crack or compromise
your derisory divides
will never unhinge us

all the thoughts that i just said
linger round and multiply in the head
not that bad to start with
i'm not angry, i'm just disappointed

it's not you it's them that are wrong
tell 'em to take out their tongues
tell 'em to take out their tongues

it's not you it's them that are wrong
tell 'em to take out their tongues
tell 'em to take out their tongues
and bring on the backlash

it's not you it's them that are wrong
tell him to take out his tongue
tell him to take out his tongue

it's not you it's them that's the fake
i won't mess with your escape
is this really your escape, yeah?
anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus yeah regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen
the lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
of course it's fancy dress
and they're all looking quite forlorn in bunny ears and devil horns and how

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus yeah regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen
i wanna see you take the jackpot out the fruit machine
and put it all back in
you've got to understand that you can never beat the bandit, no

and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
when she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
and there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
and all that is said is that you've drank a lot

and you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind yeah
you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind

and you can pour your heart out
for a reason it would block
oh you send her after nine o' clock

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus yeah regardless of what's gone before

and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked

and you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind yeah
you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind

and you can pour your heart out
around three o' clock
when the two-for-ones have done the writer's block
sat at the side of the pool at one of your houses
with wet white trousers on
and worlds collide as the evening continues, the dignity fucks off
her brother's gone off to the strippers to make up for all the lost time
she could have been one of the bitches but she's actually alright

cigarette smoker, i'm sorry
but we're all unsure how much you've had
but we think that you outta maybe not have anymore

a country home, even if we really tried
would it cease to surprise us now
and i bet your dad would like to give us all a slap
when are your parents back d'ya know?

well, i never came from no ghetto
but it wasn't nowhere near here
well, spoken girls and stilettos
aren't something to fear

cigarette smoker, i'm sorry
but we're all unsure how much you've had
but we think that you outta maybe not have anymore

cigarette smoker, i'm sorry
but we're all unsure how much you've had
but we think that you outta maybe not have anymore

cigarette smoker, cigarette smoke doesn't hide
as well as you think
and you think that it outta act as the perfect disguise

lady where's your love gone?
i was looking but can't find it anywhere
they always offer when there's loads of love around
but when you're short of some it's nowhere to be found

well, i know your game, you told him yesterday
?no chance, you'll get nothing from me?
but now she's there, you're there and everybody's there
and he's in turmoil as puzzled as can be, just like me

let's go down, down low down
where i know i should not go
oh, and she thinks she's the one
but she's just one in twenty-four
and just 'cause everybody's doing it
does that mean that i can too?

lady where's your love gone?
it was the antiseptic to the sore
to hold you by the hand must he first be in demand?
how he longs for you to long for him once more, just once more

let's go down, down low down
where i know i should not go
oh, and she thinks she's the one
but she's just one in twenty-four
and just 'cause everybody's doing it
does that mean that i can too?

her eyes went down and cut you up
and there's nothing like a dirty look from
the one you want or the one you've lost

an ache in your soul it's everybody's goal
to get what they can't have
that's why you're after her and that's why she's after him
but saying it won't change a thing
and now realizing it won't change a thing
realizing it won't change a thing
we all want some one to shout for
yeah, everyone wants somebody to adore
but heroes aren't what they seem
when you've been, where we've been

have i done something to trigger
the funny looks and the sniggers
are they there at all
or is it just paranoia

everybody's got there box
and doing what they're told
you push my faith near being lost
but we'll stick to the guns

don't care if it's marketing suicide
we won't crack or compromise
your derisory divides
will never unhinge us

and there's a couple of hundred
think they're christopher columbus
but the settlers had already settled
here long before you

just because we're having a say so
not lining up to be play-doh
in five years time will it be
who the f*ck's arctic monkeys?

'cause everybody's got there box
and doing what they're told
you push my faith near being lost
but we'll stick to the guns

don't care if it's marketing suicide

fake tales of san francisco
echo through the room
more point to a wedding disco
without a bride or groom
there's a super cool band yeah
with their trilbys and their glasses of white wine
and all the weekend rockstars are in the toilets
practicing their lines

i don't want to hear you
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear, you know
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you
i don't want to hear your

fake tales of san francisco
echo through the air
and there's a few bored faces at the back
all wishing they weren't there

and as the microphone squeaks
a young girl's telephone beeps
yeah she's dashing for the exit
oh she's running to the streets outside
"oh you've saved me," she screams down the line
"the band were fucking wank
and i'm not having a nice time"

i don't want to hear you
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear, you know
(kick me out, kick me out)

yeah but his bird said it's amazing, though
so all that's left
is the proof that love's not only blind but deaf

he talks of san francisco, he's from hunter's bar
i don't quite know the distance
but i'm sure that's far
yeah i'm sure it's pretty far

and yeah, i'd love to tell you all my problem
you're not from new york city, you're from rotherham
so get off the bandwagon, and put down the handbook
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
last night these two bouncers
and one of em's alright
the other one's the scary one
his way or no way, totalitarian

he's got no time for you
looking or breathing
how he don't want you to

so step out the queue
he makes examples of you
and there's now you can say
behind they go through to the bit where you pay
and you realize then that it's finally the time
to walk back past ten thousand eyes in the line

and you can swap jumpers and make another move
instilled in your brain you've got something to prove
to all the smirking faces and the boys in black
why can't they be pleasant?
why can't they have a laugh?

he's got his hand in your chest
he wants to give you a duff
well secretly i think they want it all to kick off
they want, arms flying everywhere and
bottles as well it's just
something to talk about
a story to tell you

well i'm so glad they turned us all away we'll put it down to fate
i said a thousand million things that i could never say this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?
this town's a different town today
this town's a different town to what it was last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday

that girl's a different girl today
said that girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday

well i'm so glad they turned us all away we'll put it down to fate
i said a thousand million things that i could never say this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?
last night what we talked about
it made so much sense
but now the haze has ascended
it don't make no sense anymore
we'll ask if we can have six in
if not we'll have to have two
well, you're coming up our end, aren't you?
so i'll get one with you
won't he let us have six in?
especially not with the food
he could have just told us no though
he didn't have to be rude

you see her with the green dress?
she talked to me at the bar
wait, how come it's already two pound fifty?
we've only gone about a yard
didn't you see she were gorgeous
she were beyond belief
but this lad at her side drinking his smirnoff ice
came and paid for her tropical reef

and i'm sitting going backwards
and i didn't want to leave
i said, "it's high green, mate
via hillsborough, please"

well, how funny were that sketch earlier
up near that taxi rank?
oh no, you would have missed it
think it were when you went to the bank
these two lads squaring up proper shouting
'bout who were next in the queue
the kind of thing that'd seem so silly
but not when they've both had a few

well calm down, temper, temper
you shouldn't get so annoyed
well, you're acting like a silly little boy
and they wanted to be men
and do some fighting in the street
they said "no surrender
no chance of retreat"

and so why are they in the taxi?
'cause i didn't want to leave
i said, "it's high green, mate
via hillsborough, please"

drunken plots hatched to jump it
ask around, "are you sure?"
went for it but the red light was showing
and red light indicates doors are secured
have you got color in your cheeks'
do you ever get the feeling that you can't shift the tide
that sticks around like something's in your teeth
and some aces up your sleeve
i had no idea that you're in deep
i dreamt about you near me every night this week
how many secrets can you keep'
'cause there's this tune i found that makes me think of you somehow
when i play it on repeat
until i fall asleep
spilling drinks on my settee

(do i wanna know?)
if this feeling flows both ways
(sad to see you go)
was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(baby we both know)
that the nights were mainly made for saying
things that you can't say tomorrow day

crawlin' back to you.

ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'cause i always do
maybe i'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
now i've thought it through

crawling back to you

so have you got the guts?
been wondering if your heart's still open and
if so i wanna know what time it shuts
simmer down and pucker up
i'm sorry to interrupt it's just i'm constantly
on the cusp of trying to kiss you
i don't know if you feel the same as i do
but we could be together, if you wanted to

(do i wanna know?)
if this feeling flows both ways
(sad to see you go)
was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(baby we both know)
that the nights were mainly made for saying
things that you can't say tomorrow day

crawling back to you

ever thought of calling when you've had a few? (calling when you've had a few)
'cause i always do ('cause i always do)
maybe i'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
now i've thought it through

crawling back to you, (do i wanna know?)
if this feeling flows both ways
(sad to see you go)
was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(baby we both know)
that the nights were mainly made for saying
things that you can't say tomorrow day

(do i wanna know?)
too busy being yours to fall
(sad to see you go)
ever thought of calling darling?
(do i wanna know)
do you want me crawling back to you?

one for the road, ooh ooh
one for the road, ooh ooh

from the bottom of your heart
the relegation zone
i saw this coming from the start
the shake, rattle and roll
the cracks in blackout blinds
cast patterns on the ceiling but you're feeling fine
i thought it was dark outside
i thought it was dark outside

so we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me round baby, i feel like i've been in here before
i've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
will you pour me one for the road?

i knew this would be on the cards
i knew you wouldn't fold
i saw this coming from the start
the shake, rattle and roll

one for the road, ooh ooh

so we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me round baby, i feel like i've been in here before
i've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
will you pour me one for the road?

the mixture hits you hard
don't get that sinking feeling, don't fall apart
some out of tune guitar
soundtrack to disaster

ooh ooh, one for the road
ooh ooh, one for the road
ooh ooh, one for the road
ooh ooh, one for the road

so we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me round baby, i feel like i've been in here before
i've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
will you pour me one for the road?
stop making the eyes at me
i'll stop making the eyes at you
what it is that surprises me
is that i don't really want you to

and your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
your name isn't rio, but i don't care for sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
well, from 1984

i wish you'd stop ignoring me
because you're sending me to despair
without a sound, yeah, you're calling me
and i don't think it's very fair

that your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
your name isn't rio, but i don't care for sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
well, from 1984

oh, there ain't no love, no montagues or capulets
just banging tunes and dj sets and
dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness!

well, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984

get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
i ain't quite where i think i am
thinking back
by the retina scan
and i've been given a reason to believe
i ain't quite where i think i am
but it's always worth half a wait
you know the face but you can't see past
the disco strobes in the stumbling blocks
wait, there's the other island now

formation displays of affection fly over (eyes roll back)
and i can see both islands now

it's the intermission
let's shake a few hands
blank expressions invite me to suspect
i ain't quite where i think i am
stackable party games
to fill the awkward silences
the disco strobes in the stumbling blocks
wait, there's the other island now

formation displays of affection fly over (eyes roll back)
and i can see both islands now

from my vantage point
a spare set of tingles will race up your spine, if i get it my way

looks like the riviera
just coming into land
but predictions would seem to suggest
that i ain't quite where i think i am

formation displays of affection flying over (eyes roll back)
and i can see both islands now
brian
top marks for not trying
so kind of you to bless us
with your effortlessness
we're grateful and so strangely comforted
and i wonder
are you putting us under
'cause we can't take our eyes
off the t-shirt and ties combination?
well, see you later, innovator

we are the arctic monkeys from high green, baby

some want to kiss, some want to kick you
there's not a net you couldn't slip through
or at least that's the impression i get
'cause you're smooth, and you're wet
and she's not aware yet
but she's yours
she'll be saying, "use me
show me the jacuzzi"
i imagine that it's there on a plate
your whole rendezvous rate
means that you'll never be frightened
to make them wait for a while
i doubt it's your style
not to get what you set
out to acquire, the eyes are on fire
you are the unforecasted storm

(brian) calm, collected and commanding
(top marks for not trying)
you leave the other stories standing
with your renditions and jokes
bet there's hundreds of blokes
that have wept 'cause you've stolen their

thunder
are you putting us under
'cause we can't take our eyes
off the t-shirt and ties combination?

well, see you later, innovator
swinging room to room
planting something new
i've ridden the riddle, i'll do it again
back to the wirral where it all began

wirral riddler

send a letter to me, baby
i'm on the edge of my seat
send a letter to me, baby
little illusion machine

riding through the gloom
something beautiful

he's ridden the riddle, he'll do it again
he's going back to the wirral where it all began

wirral riddler

send a letter to me, baby
i'm on the edge of my seat
send a letter to me, baby
little illusion machine

i tried it and i liked it but
it just never gets close enough

send a letter to me, baby

(wirral)
so tell me where have you been?
(wirral)
little illusion machine
(wirral)
hoping tonight is going to send me back to you

wow!
i thought i saw you in the battleship
but it was only a look alike
she was nothing but a vision trick
under the warning light
she was close
close enough to be your ghost
but my chances turned to toast
when i asked her if i could call her your name

i thought i saw you in the rusty hook
huddled up in wicker chair
i wandered up for a closer look
and kissed whoever was sitting there
she was close
and she held me very tightly
'til i asked awfully politely
"please, can i call you her name?"

and i elongated my lift home
yeah, i let him go the long way 'round
i smelt your scent on the seatbelt
and kept my shortcuts to myself

i thought i saw you in the parrot's beak
messin' with the smoke alarm
it was too loud for me to hear her speak
and she had a broken arm
it was close
so close that the walls were wet
and she wrote it out in letraset
"no, you can't call me her name"

tell me, where's your hiding place?
i'm worried i'll forget your face
and i've asked everyone
i'm beginning to think i imagined you all along

i elongated my lift home
yeah, i let him go the long way 'round
i smelt your scent on the seatbelt
and kept my shortcuts to myself

i saw your sister in the cornerstone
on the phone to the middle man
when i saw that she was on her own
i thought she might understand
that she was close
well, you couldn't get much closer
she said, "i'm really not supposed to, but yes
you can call me anything you want"
a mirror's image
tells me it's home time
but i'm not finished
'cause you're not by my side
and as i arrived i thought i saw you leavin'
carryin' your boots
decided that once again i was just dreamin'
of bumpin' into you

now it's three in the mornin'
and i'm tryna change your mind
left you multiple missed calls
and to my message you replied
why'd you only call me when you're high?
high
why'd you only call me when you're high?

somewhere darker
talkin' the same shite
i need a partner (high)
well, are you out tonight?
it's harder and harder to get you to listen
more i get through the gears
incapable of makin' alright decisions
and havin' bad ideas

now it's three in the mornin'
and i'm tryna change your mind
left you multiple missed calls
and to my message you reply (message you reply)
why'd you only call me when you're high?
(why'd you only call me when you're) high?
why'd you only call me when you're high?

and i can't see you here, wonder where i might?
it sort of feels like i'm runnin' out of time
i haven't found what i was hopin' to find
you said you gotta be up in the morning
gonna have an early night
and you're starting to bore me, baby
why'd you only call me when you're high?

why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
high?

thank you very much, london
how are you this evening?
i dance in my underpants
i'm gonna run for government
i'm gonna form a covers band and all
a-back there by the baby grand
did mr. winter wonderland say
"come here, kid, we really need to talk"?
bear with me, man, i lost my train of thought

i fantasize, i call it quits
i swim with the economists
and i get to the bottom of it for good
by the time reality hits
the chimes of freedom fell to bits
the shining city on the fritz
they all come out of the cracks, thirsty for blood

oh, just as the apocalypse finally gets prioritized 
and you cried some of the hottest tears you ever cried
multiplied by five
i suppose the singer must die

(woo)

singsong 'round the money tree
this stunning documentary
that no one else unfortunately saw
such beautiful photography
it's worth it for the opening scene
i've been driving 'round listening to the score
or maybe, i just imagined it all
i've played to quiet rooms like this before
bear with me, man, i lost my train of thought
he's pining for her in a people carrier
there might be buildings and pretty things to see like that
but architecture won't do

although it might say a lot about the city or town
i don't care what they've got, keep on turning them down
it don't say the funny things she does
don't even try and cheer him up, because it just won't happen

he's got the feeling again, this time on the aero plane
there might be tellies in the back of the seats in front
but rodney and del won't do

although it might take your mind off the aches and the pains
laugh when he falls through the bar but you're feeling the same
'cause she isn't there to hold your hand
she won't be waiting for you when you land

it feels like she's just nowhere near
you could well be out on your ear
this thought comes closely followed by the fear
and the thoughts of it makes you feel a bit ill

yesterday i saw a girl who looked like someone
you might knock about with
and almost shouted

and then reality kicked in within us
it seems as we become the winners
you lose a bit of summat
and half wonder if you won it at all

and don't say ow 'cause you've got no idea
and she's still nowhere near
and the thought comes closely followed by the fear
and the thoughts of it makes you feel a bit ill

despair in the departure lounge
it's one and they'll still be around at three
no signal and low battery, what's happened to me?
just when things are getting complicated
in the eye of the storm
she flicks a red-hot revelation
off the tip of her tongue
it does a dozen somersaults
and leaves you supercharged
makes me wanna blow the candles out
just to see if you glow in the dark

shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
shalalala

home sweet home, home sweet home
home sweet booby trap
i took the batteries out my mysticism
and put them in my thinking cap
she's got a telescopic hallelujah
hanging up on the wall
for when it gets too complicated
in the eye of the storm

shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
ah

and in a hellcat spangled cavern
when your judgment's on the run
and you're acting like a stranger
'cause you thought it looked like fun
and did you ever get the feeling
that these are things she's said before
her steady hands may well have done
the devil's pedicure
what you waiting for?
sing another fucking

shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
shalalala

i etched a face of a stopwatch
on the back of a raindrop
and did a swap for the sand in an hourglass

i heard an unhappy ending
it sort of sounds like you leaving
i heard the piledriver waltz
it woke me up this morning

you look like you've been for breakfast
at the heartbreak hotel
and sat in the back booth
by the pamphlets and the literature
on how to lose
your waitress was miserable
and so was your food
if you're gonna try and walk on water
make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

mystery's flashing amber
go green when you answer
but the red on the rest of the questionnaire
never changes

i heard the news that you're planning
to shoot me out of a cannon
i heard the piledriver waltz
it woke me up this morning

you look like you've been for breakfast
at the heartbreak hotel
and sat in the back booth
by the pamphlets and the literature
on how to lose
your waitress was miserable
and so was your food
if you're gonna try and walk on water
make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

oh, piledriver

i've ridden the riddle, i'll do it again
back to the wirral where it all began

wirral riddler

send a letter to me, baby
i'm on the edge of my seat
send a letter to me, baby
little illusion machine

riding through the gloom
something beautiful

he's ridden the riddle, he'll do it again
he's going back to the wirral where it all began

wirral riddler

send a letter to me, baby
i'm on the edge of my seat
send a letter to me, baby
little illusion machine

i tried it and i liked it but
it just never gets close enough

send a letter to me, baby

(wirral)
so tell me where have you been?
(wirral)
little illusion machine
(wirral)
hoping tonight is going to send me back to you

wow!
up rolls a riot van
and sparks excitement in the boys
but the policemen look annoyed
perhaps these are ones they should avoid

got a chase last night
from men with truncheons dressed in hats
we didn't do that much wrong
still ran away though, for the laugh
just for the laugh
and please just stop talking
'cause they won't find us if you do
oh, those silly boys in blue
well, they won't catch me and you

"have you been drinking, son?
you don't look old enough to me"
"i'm sorry, officer
is there a certain age you're supposed to be?
'cause nobody told me"
and up rolls the riot van
and these lads just wind the coppers up
they ask why they don't catch proper crooks
they get their address and their names took
but they couldn't care less

thrown in the riot van
and all the coppers kicked him in
and there was no way he could win
just had to take it on the chin
it's gotta be now, innit? now, now

you got the lights on in the afternoon
and the nights are drawn out long
and you're kissing to cut through the gloom
with a cough drop colored tongue
and you were sitting in the corner with the coats all piled high
when i thought you might be mine
in a small world on an exceptionally rainy tuesday night
in the right place and time

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks

well you cured my january blues
yeah, you made it all alright
i've got a feeling i might have lit the very fuse
that we were trying not to light
and you were a stranger in my phonebook i was acting like i knew
'cause i had nothing to lose
when the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't coming true
ain't it funny what you'll do

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks

the late afternoon
the ghost in your room that you always thought didn't approve of you knocking boots
never stopped you letting me get hold of the sweet spot by the scruff of your
(knee socks)

you and me could have been a team
each had a half of a king and queen seat
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby
you and me could have been a team
each had a half of a king and queen seat
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby

you and me could have been a team (all the zeros lined up)
each had a half of a king and queen seat
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby (but the number was blocked)
you and me could have been a team
each had a half of a king and queen seat (when you've come undone)
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock (all the zeros lined up)
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste 
and your knee socks

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock (all the zeros lined up, oh)
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks

huh, huh, huh
(she looks like fun)
(she looks like fun)
(she looks like fun)
(she looks like)

smile like you've got a straw in something tropical
i've got the party plugged right into my skull
wayne manor, what a memorable n.y.e

(she looks like fun) good morning
(she looks like fun) cheeseburger
(she looks like fun) snowboarding
(she looks like)

finally, there's a place with you through cloudy skies
every whimsical thought that enters my mind
look, there ain't no limit to the length of the dickheads we can be

(she looks like fun) bukowski
(she looks like fun) dogsitting
(she looks like fun) screwballing
(she looks like)

finally, there's a place where you can wag your tongue
baby, but why can't we all just get along?
dance as if somebody's watching, 'cause they are

no one's on the streets
they've moved it all online
as of march
i'm so full of shite
i need to spend less time stood around in bars
waffling on to strangers all about martial arts
and how much i respect them

(she looks like fun) key changes
(she looks like fun) re-thinking
(she looks like fun) new order
(she looks like fun)
well, oh, they might wear classic reeboks
or knackered converse
or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
but all of that's what the point is not
the point's that there ain't no romance around there

and there's the truth that they can't see
they'd probably like to throw a punch at me
and if you could only see 'em, then you would agree
agree that there ain't no romance around there

you know, oh, it's a funny thing you know
we'll tell 'em if you like
we'll tell 'em all tonight
they'll never listen
because their minds are made up
and course it's all okay to carry on that way

'cause over there, there's broken bones
there's only music, so that there's new ringtones
and it don't take no sherlock holmes
to see it's a little different around here

don't get me wrong, though, there's boys in bands
and kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
and just 'cause he's had a couple o' cans
he thinks it's all right to act like a dickhead

don't you know, oh' it's a funny thing you know
we'll tell 'em if you like
we'll tell 'em all tonight
they'll never listen
because their minds are made up
and course it's all okay to carry on that way

but i said no
oh no
well, you won't get me to go
not anywhere, not anywhere
no, i won't go
oh no no

well, over there, there's friends of mine
what can i say? i've known 'em for a long long time
and, yeah, they might overstep the line
but you just cannot get angry in the same way
no, not in the same way
said, not in the same way
oh no, oh no no
stop making the eyes at me
i'll stop making the eyes at you
what it is that surprises me
is that i don't really want you to

and your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
your name isn't rio, but i don't care for sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
well, from 1984

i wish you'd stop ignoring me
because you're sending me to despair
without a sound, yeah, you're calling me
and i don't think it's very fair

that your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
your name isn't rio, but i don't care for sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
well, from 1984

oh, there ain't no love, no montagues or capulets
just banging tunes and dj sets and
dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness

well, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
said, from 1984
well, this is a good idea
he wouldn't do it if it wasn't
he wouldn't do it if it wasn't one
well, my friend fancies you
oh, what a way to begin it all
you said, "they're always exciting words to hear"
and they woke up together not quite realizing how
awkwardly stretching and yawning
it's always hard in the morning

and i suppose that's the price you pay
well, oh, it isn't what it was
she's thinking he looks different today
and now there's nothing left to guess now

they left before the lights came on
because they didn't want to ruin what it was that was brewing
before they absolutely had to
and how can you wake up with someone you don't love
and not feel slightly fazed by it?
oh, he had a struggle
and they woke up together not quite realizing how

awkwardly stretching and yawning
it's always hard in the morning

and i suppose that's the price you pay
well, oh, it isn't what it was
she's thinking he looks different today
and now there's nothing left to guess now

well, quick, let's leave before the lights come on
'cause then you don't have to see
'cause then you don't have to see what you've done
well, quick, let's leave before the lights come on
'cause then you don't have to see
'cause then you don't have to see what you've done

i'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
i'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
i'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
i'll walk you up
i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side
with your hands between your thighs

stop and wait a sec
when you look at me like that, my darlin', what did you expect?
i'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
or i did last time i checked

not shy of a spark
the knife twists at the thought that i should fall short of the mark
frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark
the middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side
with your hands between your thighs

but i crumble completely when you cry
it seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
i'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
take my hands off of your eyes too soon

i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side
with your hands between your thighs and a smile
007 and brucey wayne
are shitting there 'selves because there's another name coming to claim
what is his to claim
10% faster with a sturdier frame

he's certainly come into his own
there's one on his arm in every land that he roams
and two consecutive nights alone
are a thing of the past as he has recently shown

they said he looks so handsome stood not dancing
drawing you in like it's boring to him
it's a war you can't win and the first and the last are two things you'll never
be my darling

another roll around and another push and shove
further away from the idea of love
and his conclusion it must be good
oh wouldn't the penny would drop with an incredible thud
they forgot to kick the tin, he knows where she's going
but don't know where she's been
and as opposed to the other thing
he'll worry about it when it's trouble he's in

they said he looks so handsome stood not dancing
drawing you in like it's boring to him
it's a war you can't win and the first and the last are two
things you'll never be my darling

things you'll never be my darling

(two things you will never be my darling)

(two things you'll never be my darling)

well they sneered and sniffed and spat at my chat up lines
not to feel like a twat at times is hard
(but not for this kid, not when they come to you)
well, last night these two bouncers
and one of 'em's alright, the other one's the scary one
his way or no way, totalitarian
he's got no time for your looking or breathing
how he don't want you to, so step out the queue
he makes examples of you and there's nowt you can say
behind they go through to the bit where you pay
and you realize then that it's finally the time
to walk back past ten-thousand eyes in the line
and you can swap jumpers and make another move
instilled in your brain, you've got something to prove
to all the smirking faces and the boys in black
why can't they be pleasant? why can't they have a laugh?
he's got his hand in your chest, he wants to give you a duff
well, secretly i think they want you all to kick off
they want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well
it's just something to talk about, a story to tell, yeah

well, i'm so glad they turned us all away
we'll put it down to fate
i said a thousand million things
that i could never say this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

well, this town's a different town today
said, this town's a different town to what it was last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday
and that girl's a different girl today
said, that girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday
of course not

well, i'm so glad they turned us all away
we'll put it down to fate
i thought a thousand million things
that i could never think this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

last night, what we talked about
it made so much sense
but now the haze has ascended
it don't make no sense anymore
said, last night, what we talked about
it made so much sense
but now the haze has ascended
it don't make no sense anymore, oh

da-da, da-da-da
da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah, regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen
the lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
of course it's fancy dress
and they're all looking quite forlorn in bunny ears and devil horns and how

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah, regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen

i wanna see you take the jackpot out the fruit machine
and put it all back in
you've got to understand that you can never beat the bandit, no

and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
when she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
and there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
and all that is said is that you've drank a lot

and you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind, yeah
you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind

and you can pour your heart out
for a reason it would block
oh, you send her after nine o'clock

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah, regardless of what's gone before

and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
when she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
and there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
and all that is said is that you've drank a lot

and you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind, yeah
you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind

and you can pour your heart out
around three o'clock
when the two-for-ones have done the writer's block
you used to get it in your fishnets
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
landed in a very common crisis
everything's in order in a black hole
nothing seems as pretty as the past though
that bloody mary's lacking in tabasco
remember when he used to be a rascal?

oh, the boy's a slag
the best you ever had
the best you ever had
is just a memory and those dreams
weren't as daft as they seem
not as daft as they seemed
my love, when you dream them up

flicking through a little book of sex tips
remember when the boys were all electric?
now, when she tells she's gonna get it
i'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
clinging to not getting sentimental
said, she wasn't going, but she went, still
likes her gentlemen to not be gentle
was it a mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

oh, the boy's a slag
the best you ever had
the best you ever had
is just a memory and those dreams
weren't as daft as they seem
not as daft as they seemed
my love, when you dream them up
oh, flo, where did you go?
where did you go?
where did you go? oh oh

you're falling about
you took a left off last laugh lane
just soundin' it out
but you're not coming back again

you're falling about
you took a left off last laugh lane
you were just soundin' it out
but you're not coming back again

you used to get it in your fishnets (falling about)
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness (you took a left off last laugh lane)
landed in a very common crisis
everything's in order in a black hole (were sounding it out)
is everything as pretty as the past though?
that bloody mary's lacking in tabasco (you're not coming back again)
remember when he used to be a rascal? oh
he looks as if he hasn't slept
his hair is purposely unkept
in many doorways, people wept
when you crafted your plan

shadows underneath the eyes
and everywhere the bastard lies
my lack of proof is your disguise
you won't remember me
there's nothing really i can say
but "sorry, mate" and walk away
i could be wrong on this, you play your game
this world is full of most unkind
and horrible is redefined
i can't imagine that you'd mind at all

you're lying again, your conscience isn't your friend
and the only thing you're sobbing at is your imagination
lying again, your conscience isn't your friend
and the only thing you're sobbing at is your imagination
is he really on the street?
desperation or deceit?
and what he's wearing on his feet
won't solve our mystery

and i am baffled by how you stand there, soaking it in
and do you hide your identity where you hide your grin?
you'd better hide your grin

shadows underneath the eyes
and everywhere the bastard lies
my lack of proof is your disguise
you won't remember me

there's nothing really i can say
but "sorry, mate" and walk away
i could be wrong on this, you play your game
this world is full of most unkind
and horrible is redefined
i can't imagine that you'd mind at all

you're lying again, your conscience isn't your friend
and the only thing you're sobbing at is your imagination
lying again, your conscience isn't your friend
and the only thing you're sobbing at is your imagination
they've sped up to the point where they provoke
the punchline before they have told the joke
plenty of desperation to be seen
staring at the television screen
they've sped up to the point where they provoke
you to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke
well sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
it wasn't in the top 100 list

and it's the thousandth time that's it's even bolder
don't be surprised when you get bent over
they told ya, but you were dying for it

saw it and she grabbed it, and it wasn't what it seemed
the kids all dream of making it, whatever that means
another variation on a theme
a tangle on the television and the magazine
do you reckon that they do it for a joke?
do you reckon that they make 'em take an oath
that says that we are defenders
of any poseur or professional pretender around

when did your list replace the twist and turn
like a fist replaced the kiss?
don't concern us with your bollocks, i don't want your prayer
save it for the morning after

and it's the thousandth time that's it's even bolder
don't be surprised when you get bent over
they told ya, but you were gagging for it

let's have a game on the teddy picker
not quick enough, can i have it quicker?
already thick and you're getting thicker
let's have a game on the teddy picker
not quick enough, can i have it quicker?
already thick and you're getting thicker

presuming that all things are equal
who'd want to be men of the people
when there's people like you?
brian
top marks for not trying
so kind of you to bless us
with your effortlessness
we're grateful and so strangely comforted
and i wonder
are you putting us under
'cause we can't take our eyes
off the t-shirt and ties combination?
well, see you later, innovator

some want to kiss, some want to kick you
there's not a net you couldn't slip through
or at least that's the impression i get
'cause you're smooth, and you're wet
and she's not aware yet
but she's yours
she'll be saying, "use me
show me the jacuzzi"
i imagine that it's there on a plate
your whole rendezvous rate
means that you'll never be frightened
to make them wait for a while
i doubt it's your style
not to get what you set
out to acquire, the eyes are on fire
you are the unforecasted storm

(brian) calm, collected and commanding
(top marks for not trying)
you leave the other stories standing
with your renditions and jokes
bet there's hundreds of blokes
that have wept 'cause you've stolen their

thunder
are you putting us under
'cause we can't take our eyes
off the t-shirt and ties combination?

well, see you later, innovator
well, the morning was complete
where there was tears on the steering wheel, dripping on the seat
several hours or several weeks
i'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak

it's the beginning of the end 
the car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend
ask anyone, they'll tell you
that it's these times that it tends
to start to break in half, to start to fall apart
hold on to your heart

and do me a favor and break my nose
or do me a favor and tell me to go away
or do me a favor and stop asking questions

well, she walked away while her shoes were untied 
when the eyes were all red
you could see that we'd cried 
and i watched, and i waited 'til she was inside
forcing a smile and waving goodbye

curiosity becomes a heavy load
too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
curiosity becomes a heavy load
too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold

and do me a favor, and ask, if you need some help
she said, do me a favor, and stop flattering yourself
and to tear apart the ties that bind
perhaps "f*ck off" might be too kind
perhaps "f*ck off" might be too kind
this house is a circus, berserk as f*ck
we tend to see that as a perk, though look 
what it's done to your friends
their memories are pretend
and the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
this house is a circus, berserk as f*ck
we tend to see that as a perk, though look
what it's done to your friends
their memories are pretend
and the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end

there's a room full of trouble and there's lovers to be had
those ones who make sinners out of such lovely lads
scaling the corridors for maidens in the maze
and any anomaly is slipping into familiar ways
and we're forever unfulfilled and can't think why
like a search for murder clues in dead man's eyes
forever unfulfilled and can't think why
like a search for murder clues in dead man's eyes

the more you open your mouth, the more you're forcing performance
and all the attention is leading me to feel important
(gimme obnoxious, gimme obnoxious now)
now that we're here, we may as well go too far

wriggling around in incidents you won't forget
there's certainly some venom in the looks that you collect
aimlessly gazing at the faces in the queue
and we're struggling with the notion that it's life, not film

this house is a circus, berserk as f*ck (we're forever unfulfilled)
we tend to see that as a perk, though look (can't think why)
what it's done to your friends
their memories are pretend (like a search for murder clues)
and the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
just when things are getting complicated
in the eye of the storm
she flicks a red-hot revelation
off the tip of her tongue
it does a dozen somersaults
and leaves you supercharged
makes me wanna blow the candles out
just to see if you glow in the dark

shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
shalalala

home sweet home, home sweet home
home sweet booby trap
i took the batteries out my mysticism
and put them in my thinking cap
she's got a telescopic hallelujah
hanging up on the wall
for when it gets too complicated
in the eye of the storm

shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
ah

and in a hellcat spangled cavern
when your judgment's on the run
and you're acting like a stranger
'cause you thought it looked like fun
and did you ever get the feeling
that these are things she's said before
her steady hands may well have done
the devil's pedicure
what you waiting for?
sing another fucking

shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
oh baby, i'm wanting to do you a swap
i'll give you anything, yeah
in return for the noises you've got
and i can see you want to be attended to
just count to twenty-nine and i'll attend to you
oh for sure, well certainly, yeah yeah yeah

wavin' bye to the train or the bus
i'm ever so worried because
i don't want to get all forgotten

so very comfortable
don't really need to put up my feet
and even in fat sam's grand slam
can't see it being easier to speak
when you've karate-kicked your way to someone new
and i'm a memory and don't know what to do
all on his own
collecting his dole n' stuff

wavin' bye to the train or the bus
i'm ever so worried because
i don't want to get all forgotten
'cause we know
yeah, we know-oh-oh-oh
oh we know, a whoa-oh-oh

don't know where we're going, baby
i s'pose it depends
but even if we're all far apart
we can all come back and all be fine
we'll be able to be together again

be together again
be together again
be together again

everybody will be together again
sat at the side of the pool at one of your houses
with wet white trousers on
and worlds collide as the evening continues, the dignity fucks off
her brother's gone off to the strippers to make up for all the lost time
she could have been one of the bitches but she's actually alright

cigarette smoker, i'm sorry
but we're all unsure how much you've had
but we think that you ought to maybe not have anymore

a country home, even if we really tried
would it cease to surprise us now
and i bet your dad would like to give us all a slap
when are your parents back do ya know?

well, i never came from no ghetto
but it wasn't nowhere near here
well, spoken girls and stilettos
aren't something to fear

cigarette smoker, i'm sorry
but we're all unsure how much you've had
but we think that you ought to maybe not have anymore

cigarette smoker, i'm sorry
but we're all unsure how much you've had
but we think that you ought to maybe not have anymore

cigarette smoker, cigarette smoke doesn't hide
as well as you think
and you think that it ought to act as the perfect disguise
black as a beacon
in a river of shimmering fog
yes she was

if you were heat-seeking
she was hard to ignore
yes she was

and she snapped
wing mirrors off of cadillacs
the particularly pretty ones

and that
meant she never had to strain her back
when she was putting her lippy on

well, time tastes bland
when she's not around
and you'd sit and you'd sink and approach the brink
before she showed you how to shake love's steady hand
that knows

and she snapped
wing mirrors off of cadillacs
the particularly pretty ones

and that
meant she never had to strain her back
when she was putting her lippy on

shake love's steady hand
shake love's steady
she floats like a niccy rush but she stings like a b-flat
the blond-o-sonic shimmer trap

and she snapped
wing mirrors off of cadillacs
the particularly pretty ones

and that
meant she never had to strain her back
when she was putting her lippy on
don't get emotional, that ain't like you
yesterday's still leaking through the roof
that's nothing new
i know i promised this is what i wouldn't do
somehow giving it the old romantic fool
seems to better suit the mood

so if you wanna walk me to the car
you oughta know i'll have a heavy heart
so can we please be absolutely sure
that there's a mirrorball?

you're getting cynical and that won't do
i'd throw the rose tint back on the exploded view
darling, if i were you
and how's that insatiable appetite?
for the moment when you look them in the eyes
and say, "baby, it's been nice"

so do you wanna walk me to the car?
i'm sure to have a heavy heart
so can we please be absolutely sure
that there's a mirrorball for me?
la, ohh
oh, there'd better be a mirrorball for me
i so wanted it long but she cut it short
and now i'm catching a cold
i told you not but no crack in the doobie
but it was already rolled

oh, i turned...
get out the way, mister
with your short sharp tips
no, i won't read your lips right now
and baby, hey
you send a shiver down my spine
but do you read ...
we all want someone to shout for
yeah, everyone wants somebody to adore
but your heroes aren't what they seem
when you've been where we've been

have ...
have you got color in your cheeks?
do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
that sticks around like summat in your teeth?
are there some aces up your sleeve?
have you no idea that you're in deep?
i've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
how many secrets can you keep?
'cause there's this tune i found
that makes me think of you somehow and i play it on repeat
until i fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

(do i wanna know?) if this feelin' flows both ways?
(sad to see you go) was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(baby, we both know) that the nights were mainly made
for sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

crawlin' back to you
ever thought of callin' when
you've had a few?
'cause i always do
maybe i'm too
busy bein' yours
to fall for somebody new
now, i've thought it through
crawlin' back to you

so have you got the guts?
been wonderin' if your heart's still open
and if so, i wanna know what time it shuts
simmer down an' pucker up, i'm sorry to interrupt
it's just i'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
i don't know if you feel the same as i do
but we could be together if you wanted to

(do i wanna know?) if this feelin' flows both ways?
(sad to see you go) was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(baby, we both know) that the nights were mainly made
for sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

crawlin' back to you (crawlin' back to you)
ever thought of callin' when
you've had a few? (had a few)
'cause i always do ('cause i always do)
maybe i'm too (maybe i'm too busy)
busy bein' yours (bein' yours)
to fall for somebody new
now, i've thought it through
crawlin' back to you

(do i wanna know?) if this feelin' flows both ways?
(sad to see you go) was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(baby, we both know) that the nights were mainly made
for sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
(do i wanna know?) too busy bein' yours to fall
(sad to see you go) ever thought of callin', darlin'?
(do i wanna know?) do you want me crawlin' back to you?
arabella's got some interstellar-gator skin boots
and a helter skelter 'round her little finger and i ride it endlessly
she's got a barbarella silver swimsuit
and when she needs to shelter from reality she takes a dip in my daydreams

my days end best when this sunset gets itself
behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side
it's much less picturesque without her catching the light
the horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

as arabella
as arabella
just might have tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure

arabella's got a seventies head
but she's a modern lover
it's an exploration, she's made of outer space
and her lips are like the galaxy's edge
and her kiss the colour of a constellation falling into place

that's magic in a cheetah print coat
just a slip underneath it i hope
asking if i can have one of those
organic cigarettes that she smokes
wraps her lips round the mexican coke
makes you wish that you were the bottle
takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like…

just might have tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure
what's been happening in your world?
what have you been up to?
i heard that you fell in love
or near enough
i gotta tell you the truth…

i wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
i get the feeling i left it too late, but baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
if that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
i'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
snap out of it

forever isn't for everyone
is forever for you?
it sounds like settling down or giving up
but it don't sound much like you girl

i wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
i get the feeling i left it too late, but baby

snap out of it

under a spell you're hypnotized
darling how could you be so blind?

it's gotta be now, innit? now, now

you got the lights on in the afternoon
and the nights are drawn out long
and you're kissing to cut through the gloom
with a cough drop colored tongue
and you were sitting in the corner with the coats all piled high
when i thought you might be mine
in a small world on an exceptionally rainy tuesday night
in the right place and time

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks

well you cured my january blues
yeah, you made it all alright
i've got a feeling i might have lit the very fuse
that we were trying not to light
and you were a stranger in my phonebook i was acting like i knew
'cause i had nothing to lose
when the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't coming true
ain't it funny what you'll do

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks

the late afternoon
the ghost in your room that you always thought didn't approve of you knocking boots
never stopped you letting me get hold of the sweet spot by the scruff of your
(knee socks)

you and me could have been a team
each had a half of a king and queen seat
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby
you and me could have been a team
each had a half of a king and queen seat
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby

you and me could have been a team (all the zeros lined up)
each had a half of a king and queen seat
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby (but the number was blocked)
you and me could have been a team
each had a half of a king and queen seat (when you've come undone)
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock (all the zeros lined up)
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste 
and your knee socks

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock (all the zeros lined up, oh)
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks

huh, huh, huh
they've sped up to the point where they provoke
the punchline before they have told the joke
plenty of desperation to be seen
staring at the television screen
they've sped up to the point where they provoke
you to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke
well sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
it wasn't in the top 100 list

and it's the thousandth time that's it's even bolder
don't be surprised when you get bent over
they told ya, but you were dying for it

saw it and she grabbed it, and it wasn't what it seemed
the kids all dream of making it, whatever that means
another variation on a theme
a tangle on the television and the magazine
do you reckon that they do it for a joke?
do you reckon that they make 'em take an oath
that says that we are defenders
of any poseur or professional pretender around

when did your list replace the twist and turn
like a fist replaced the kiss?
don't concern us with your bollocks, i don't want your prayer
save it for the morning after

and it's the thousandth time that's it's even bolder
don't be surprised when you get bent over
they told ya, but you were gagging for it

let's have a game on the teddy picker
not quick enough, can i have it quicker?
already thick and you're getting thicker
let's have a game on the teddy picker
not quick enough, can i have it quicker?
already thick and you're getting thicker

presuming that all things are equal
who'd want to be men of the people
when there's people like you?
i was biting the time zone
and we embellished the banks of our bloodstreams
and threw caution to the colorful 
then we fell asleep in the car
until the bumps woke me up in your grip 
and the tide took me to your mouth
and then swept me back down to your palms 

it's them that put me inside the reminder 
that yours is the only ocean (yours is the only ocean) 
that i wanna swing from
yours is the only ocean
that i wanna hang on 

i've got this ego mechanic
she's always trying to give me vitamins 
ah, she'd be frightened of your reflection
i preferred her as a cartoon 

if i could be someone else for a week
i'd spend it chasing after you
'cause she's not shattering my attitude
no matter how she folds the potion 

yours is the only ocean (yours is the only ocean)
that i wanna swing from
yours is the only ocean
that i want to hang on to 

(i'm swinging on)

yours is the only ocean
yours is the only ocean
yours is the only ocean
yours is the only ocean 

potion approaching, shield your eyes
potion approaching, visualize
holding a token, swollen in size
potion approaching, shield your eyes 

oh, but if we're gonna escape though
we really ought to think it through
would you like me to build you a go-kart?
it's gotta be now, innit? now, now

there's always somebody taller with more of a wit 
and he's equipped to enthrall her and her friends think he's fit
and you just can't measure up though, you don't have a prayer
wishing that you'd made the most of her when she was there 

they've got engaged, there's no intention of a wedding 
he's pinched your bird and he'd probably kick your head in 

bigger boys and stolen sweethearts 
oh, you're better off without her anyway 
you said you wasn't sad to see her go 
yeah, but i know you were though

now you don't know what she's up to, you can only assume
if she's not in the front of the shops then they've gone to his room
bet she's gone 'round in her school stuff, bet that's what he likes
i know you thought she were different and you thought she were nice

but she's not nice, she's pretty fucking far from nice
she's looking at you funny rarely looking at you twice

bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
oh, you're better off without her anyway
you said you wasn't sad to see her go
yeah, but it's so clear you were though 

have you heard what she's been doing? never did it for me 
he picks her up at the school gates at twenty past three 
she's been with all of the boys but never went very far 
and she wagged english and science just to go in his car 

they've got engaged, there's no intention of a wedding 
he's pinched my bird and he'd probably kick my head in 
oh, now the girls have grown 
yeah, but i'm sure that they still carry on in similar ways 

bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
oh, you're better off without her anyway
you said you wasn't sad to see her go
yeah, but i'm only pretending, you know 
yeah, i'm only pretending, you know 
i was only pretending, you know 
i was only pretending, you know
well, oh, they might wear classic reeboks
or knackered converse
or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
but all of that's what the point is not
the point's that there ain't no romance around there

and there's the truth that they can't see
they'd probably like to throw a punch at me
and if you could only see 'em, then you would agree
agree that there ain't no romance around there

you know, oh, it's a funny thing you know
we'll tell 'em if you like
we'll tell 'em all tonight
they'll never listen
because their minds are made up
and course it's all okay to carry on that way

'cause over there, there's broken bones
there's only music, so that there's new ringtones
and it don't take no sherlock holmes
to see it's a little different around here

don't get me wrong, though, there's boys in bands
and kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
and just 'cause he's had a couple o' cans
he thinks it's all right to act like a dickhead

don't you know, oh' it's a funny thing you know
we'll tell 'em if you like
we'll tell 'em all tonight
they'll never listen
because their minds are made up
and course it's all okay to carry on that way

but i said no
oh no
well, you won't get me to go
not anywhere, not anywhere
no, i won't go
oh no no

well, over there, there's friends of mine
what can i say? i've known 'em for a long long time
and, yeah, they might overstep the line
but you just cannot get angry in the same way
no, not in the same way
said, not in the same way
oh no, oh no no
she was marrying a matador and he was with the weather girl
a very clever girl who stood out among several once
a terrible dilemma and forever he'll regret this day he didn't make the
rescue from the bull ring
sulking won't get you nowhere son
there's blood on your chin where you've bitten your tongue
smitten but might not be smitten for long if you're still sitting she'll soon
be smitten and gone
if you were there, beware the serpent soul pinchers
three-hundred and fifty "no, thank you"s and nobody flinches
go on, girl, go on, give us something gruesome
we require your grief, the thugs help the thieves
as they're trying to rob the words from her gob and
take the source of the innocence

if you were there, beware the serpent soul pinchers
can't you sense she was never meant to fill column inches
ain't you had enough? what you're trying to dig up
isn't there to be dug, the thieves help the thugs
as they're trying to beat the good grace of a sweetheart
out to the point she'll comply

and why leave her on her own?
if i'd have known then i wouldn't have said it
i wouldn't have said it if i would have known
why leave her on her own?
if i predicted tears then i wouldn't have said it
i wouldn't have said it if i would have known

there's a circle of witches, ambitiously vicious they are
our attempts to remind them of reason won't get us that far
but i don't know what it is that they want
i don't know what it is that they want
but i haven't got it to give
and she hasn't got it to give
well, now then, mardy bum
i've seen your frown and it's like looking down
the barrel of a gun
and it goes off
and out come all these words
oh, there's a very pleasant side to you
a side i much prefer

it's one that laughs and jokes around
remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
to get things off the ground
and it was up, up and away
oh, but it's right hard to remember that
on a day like today
when you're all argumentative
and you've got the face on

well, now then, mardy bum
oh, i'm in trouble again, aren't i?
i thought as much
'cause you turned over there
pulling that silent disappointment face
the one that i can't bare

well, can't we just laugh and joke around?
remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
to get things off the ground
and it was up, up and away
oh, but it's right hard to remember that
on a day like today
when you're all argumentative
and you've got the face on

and, yeah, i'm sorry i was late
but i missed the train
and then the traffic was a state
and i can't be arsed to carry on in this debate
that reoccurs, oh, when you say i don't care
but, of course i do, yeah, i clearly do

so laugh and joke around?
remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
to get things off the ground
and it was up, up and away
oh, but it's right hard to remember that
on a day like today
when you're all argumentative
and you've got the face on
darlin' tell me something i don't know
be my baby, be my gto
call me something no one else calls me
i forget how i want it
that electricity

my heart was breaking and got left unlocked
didn't see you sneak in but i'm glad you stopped
tell me something i don't already know
like how you get your kisses to fill me with electricity

love like locked horns
love like dominos
be my midnight
be my ebb and flow
i forget how i want it
how it crept up on me
it takes over
electricity

and my heart was breaking and got left unlocked
didn't see you sneak in but i'm glad you stopped
tell me something i don't already know
like how you get your kisses to fill me with electricity

separated
there i face it
love like thunder
love like falling snow

tell me something i don't already know
like how you get your kisses to fill me with electricity
get on your dancing shoes
there's one thing on your mind
hoping they're looking for you
sure you'll be rummaging through

oh and the shit, shock, the horror
you've seen your future bride
yeah, but it's oh so absurd
for you to say the first word
so you're waiting and waiting and

the only reason that you came
so what you scared for
oh, don't you always do the same
it's what you there for, don't you know

the lights are flashing
down in here tonight
and some might exchange a glance
but keep pretending to dance

don't act like it's not happening
as if it's impolite
to go and mention your name
instead you'll just do the same
as they all do, and hope for the best

the only reason that you came
so what you scared for
well don't you always do the same
it's what you're there for but no

get on your dancing shoes
you sexy little swine
hoping they're looking for you
sure you'll be rummaging through

and i said the shit, shock, horror
you've seen your future bride, yeah
yeah, but it's oh so absurd
for you to say the first word
so you're waiting and waiting
i've seen your eyes as they fix on me
what is he doing?
what on earth's the plan, has he got one?
you better give me some pointers
since you are the big rocket launcher
and i'm just the shotgun
well, i ain't got no dollar signs in my eyes
that might be a surprise but it's true
said, i'm not like you
and i don't want your advice or your praise
or to move in the ways you do
and i never will

'cause all you people are vampires
and all your stories are stale
and though you pretend to stand by us
i know you're certain we'll fail

well, i've seen your eyes as they fix on me
full of confusion
your snarl is just so condescending
try to explain that we're on to a win
if the fee we got in
near recoups what we're spending
he said, "i can't believe that you drove all that way
well, how much did they pay ya? how much did they pay ya?
you'd have been better to stay round our way"
thinking 'bout things but not actually doing the things

'cause all you people are vampires
and all your stories are stale
and though you pretend to stand by us
i know you're certain we'll fail

'cause all you people are vampires
and all your stories are stale
and though you pretend to stand by us
i know you're certain we'll fail

all you people are vampires

come and take a leaf out of my book
i'm a crack dealing crook
selling lots of rock and roll to the masses
and i know if you wanna take a trip to the city
we can go (to gibraltar)
we can go (to gibraltar)

let's go, let's go, let's go, come on
come on, come on, come on, come on
let's go, let's go, let's go, come on

give me your switch card
i'll book some flights

1996 and i'm stuck at the bottom of a truck
on the run from the mi5, got detectives
and i'll say if you catch me that i really wish
that i had stayed (in gibraltar)
that i had stayed (in gibraltar)

let's go, let's go, let's go, come on
come on, come on, come on, come on
let's go, let's go, let's go, come on

give me your switch card
i'll book some flights
take a little walk to the edge of town and go across the tracks
where the viaduct looms like a bird of doom as it shifts and cracks
where secrets lie in the border fires in the humming wires
well, you know you're never coming back

past the square, past the bridge, past the mills, past the stacks
on a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man
in a dusty black coat with a red right hand

he'll wrap you in his arms and tell you that you've been a good boy
he'll rekindle all the dreams it took you a lifetime to destroy
he'll reach deep into the hole, heal your shrinking soul
and there won't be a single thing that you can do

he's a god, he's a man, he's a ghost, he's a guru
they're whispering his name 'cross this disappearing land
but hidden in his coat is a red right hand

you don't have no money? he'll get you some
if you haven't got no car, he'll get you one
you've got no self-respect, you feel like an insect
well, don't you worry, buddy, 'cause here he comes
through the ghettos and the barrows and the bowery and the slum
a shadow is cast wherever he stands
stacks of green paper in his red right hand

you'll see him in your nightmares, you'll see him in your dreams
he'll appear out of nowhere, but he's not what he seems
you'll see him in your head on the tv screen
hey, buddy, i'm warning you to turn it off

he's a ghost, he's a god, he's a man, he's a guru
you're one microscopic cog in his catastrophic plan
designed and directed by his red right hand
he sank into their calculations
and snorted on the stench
of their arithmetic
looked for the boy who was hanging his head low
more trophies than ideas, to follow their pretense

with a scowl in his pocket and a smile on his face
he followed with obedience
and fell in the nettles

afterwards those spikey whispers said he bought his own rope
and skipped the bits they loathed
didn't scramble to find a dock leaf to capture back our hope
to advice his mind had closed
he lost all of his footholes

and with a scowl in his pocket and a smile on his face
he followed with obedience
and fell in the nettles, fell in the nettles, fell in the nettles

he was a toothpick!
and the garlic and the cinder upon the path
had failed to blunt or hinder the slow collapse
clinging to the doorframe he was dragged
off to a reminder of where he had been

with a smile in his pocket
and a scowl on his face
he had nowhere to flee
so sat content in the nettles
i saw you dancin'
you moved like sinatra
on speed

the lights were a-flashin'
and tongues were a-waggin'
over you
it's too late for tryin'
it's too late for denyin'
all those little things
you and me have done
i'm sorry, hon'
i was hopin' for a recall
a mix of you high from the sun
oh, but nothin'
only lone magpies come

i saw you dancin'
you moved like sinatra
on speed
well, this is a good idea
he wouldn't do it if it wasn't
he wouldn't do it if it wasn't one

well, my friend fancies you
oh, what a way to begin it all
you said they're always exciting words to hear

they woke up together
not quite realizing how
awkwardly stretching and yawning
it's always hard in the morning

and i suppose that's the price you pay
well, oh, it isn't what it was
she's thinking he looks different today
and oh, there's nothing left to guess now

they left before the lights came on
because they didn't want to ruin
what it was that was brewing
before they absolutely had to

and how can you wake up
with someone you don't love?
and not feel slightly phased by it
oh, he had a struggle

they woke up together
not quite realizing how
awkwardly stretching and yawning
it's always hard in the morning

and i suppose that's the price you pay
well, oh, it isn't what it was
she's thinking he looks different today
and oh, there's nothing left to guess now

quick, let's leave
before the lights come on
'cause then you don't have to see
'cause then you don't have to see what you've done

quick, let's leave
before the lights come on
'cause then you don't have to see
'cause then you don't have to see what you've done

i'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
i'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
i'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
well, it's ever so funny
'cause i don't think you're special, i don't think you're cool
you're just probably alright
but under these lights you look beautiful
and i'm struggling, i can't see through your fake tan
yeah, and you know it for a fact that everybody's eating out of your hands

but what do you know?
oh, you know nothing
yeah, but i'll still take you home
oh, yeah, i'll still take you home
so what do you know?
said, you don't know nothing

well, fancy seeing you in here
you're all tarted up and you don't look the same
well, i haven't seen you since last year
yeah, and surprisingly you have forgotten my name
but you know it, yeah, and you knew it all along
oh and you say you have forgotten
but you're fibbing, go on, tell me i'm wrong

so what do you know?
oh, you know nothing
yeah, but i'll still take you home
oh, yeah, i'll still take you home
so what do you know?
oh, you don't know nothing, no

oh-woah, woah, woah
oh-woah, woah, woah
da-da, da-da-da, da-da, da-da
da-da, da-da, da-da-da
oh-woah, woah, woah

oh, so what do you know?
yeah, you don't know nothing, no
yeah, but i'd still take you home
oh, yeah, i'll still take you home
i said, what do you know?
oh, you don't know nothing

i fancy you with a passion
oh, you're a topshop princess, a rockstar, too
but you're a fad and you're a fashion
and i'm having a job trying to talk to you
but it's alright, yeah, i'll put it on one side
oh, 'cause everybody's looking, you've got control of everyone's eyes
including mine
just another microcosm somewhere in the ether
putting a world to rights with bing crosby eyes
oversharing and its bitter aftertaste
exactly the wrong time in exactly the wrong place
save it for a rainy day
baby, you go hard in the paint
it's just another race to anyways

philanthropic toga party
what a place for both the
opposite sides of my double life to finally collide
sharing secrets i was taking to the grave
nosebleeds from epiphanies i took full in the face
oh, come all by the fire, babe, let's all participate
in yet another race to anyways
oh, how's your mum and dad been doing with the generation gap?

yeah, i'm behind my movie camera
i've got my megaphone
you can call me alexander
it's nice to meet you all

listening to the shipping forecast
driving to the airport
me and the guys
metropolis ablaze in the rear view
devising methods to both have and eat your cake
mmm, just like the ones that mother nature used to bake
you look as if you know exactly what i'm gonna say
is just another race to
anyways
he knew what he wanted to say
but he did not want to word it
the dirty little herbert
was seeking an escape
but the place was well-guarded
the guiltiness that started
soon as the other part had stopped

d is for delightful
and try and keep your trousers on
i think you should know you're his favorite worst nightmare

d is for desperately trying to simulate
what it was that was all right
three quarters of an hour ago
that had led him to be in a position
on every compromission
and every other episode

he's nearing the brink, but he thinks first
the parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene

arabella's got some interstellar gator-skin boots
and a helter skelter 'round her little finger and i ride it endlessly
she's got a barbarella silver swimsuit
and when she needs to shelter from reality she takes a dip in my daydreams

my days end best when the sunset gets itself
behind that little lady sittin' on the passenger side
it's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
the horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

as arabella, oh
arabella
just might've tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure

arabella's got a seventies head
but she's a modern lover, it's an exploration, she's made of outer space
and her lips are like the galaxy's edge
and her kiss the color of a constellation fallin' into place

my days end best when the sunset gets itself
behind that little lady sittin' on the passenger side
it's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
the horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

as arabella, oh
as arabella
just might've tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure

that's magic in a cheetah-print coat
just a slip underneath it i hope
askin' if i can have one of those
organic cigarettes that she smokes
wraps her lips 'round a mexican coke
makes you wish that you were the bottle
takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like
woo!

i just might've tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure

i'd like to play for you now, ladies and gentleman 
the uh, title track from our new lp
entitled, "tranquility base hotel and casino", get down
anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah, regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen
the lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
of course it's fancy dress
and they're all looking quite forlorn in bunny ears and devil horns and how

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah, regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen

i wanna see you take the jackpot out the fruit machine
and put it all back in
you've got to understand that you can never beat the bandit, no

and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
when she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
and there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
and all that is said is that you've drank a lot

and you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind, yeah
you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind

and you can pour your heart out
for a reason it would block
oh, you send her after nine o'clock

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah, regardless of what's gone before

and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
when she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
and there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
and all that is said is that you've drank a lot

and you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind, yeah
you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind

and you can pour your heart out
around three o'clock
when the two-for-ones have done the writer's block
you've never met before
but still she greets you like a long lost rock and roll
she's definitely one of those
where you go wherever she goes

oh my body and my mind
both start talking at the exact same time
try'na think of ways to make her mine
but they're difficult to find

it's not what i need
no, your love's not what i need
so don't give it to me

and she said: 'oh, well i knew this will sound cold
but i really have to go
oh it's not that i'm not free
there's nowhere i need to be
it's just your love's not what i need
so don't give it to me'

it's not what i need
no, your love's not what i need
so don't give it to me

she said: i baby i can never leave you
how can i believe you when you can't believe your luck
no point sticking to the plan when it's going slow

it's more a hunger than a thirst
you'll break it out the second time
before you know about the first
looks well-equipped to leave you in the lurch
but you'll let her do her worst

and it's not hard to tell
it's obvious the other angels faces fell
when she told them that she had to go
traded her wings and overcoat for something colorful

(tha knows)

well, oh, they might wear classic reeboks
or knackered converse
or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
but all of that's what the point is not
the point's that there ain't no romance around there

and there's the truth that they can't see
they'd probably like to throw a punch at me
and if you could only see 'em, then you would agree
agree that there ain't no romance around there

you know, oh, it's a funny thing you know
we'll tell 'em if you like
we'll tell 'em all tonight
they'll never listen
because their minds are made up
and course it's all okay to carry on that way

'cause over there, there's broken bones
there's only music, so that there's new ringtones
and it don't take no sherlock holmes
to see it's a little different around here

don't get me wrong, though, there's boys in bands
and kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
and just 'cause he's had a couple o' cans
he thinks it's all right to act like a dickhead

don't you know, oh' it's a funny thing you know
we'll tell 'em if you like
we'll tell 'em all tonight
they'll never listen
because their minds are made up
and course it's all okay to carry on that way

but i said no
oh no
well, you won't get me to go
not anywhere, not anywhere
no, i won't go
oh no no

well, over there, there's friends of mine
what can i say? i've known 'em for a long long time
and, yeah, they might overstep the line
but you just cannot get angry in the same way
no, not in the same way
said, not in the same way
oh no, oh no no
brian
top marks for not trying
so kind of you to bless us
with your effortlessness
we're grateful and so strangely comforted
and i wonder
are you putting us under
'cause we can't take our eyes
off the t-shirt and ties combination?
well, see you later, innovator

some want to kiss, some want to kick you
there's not a net you couldn't slip through
or at least that's the impression i get
'cause you're smooth, and you're wet
and she's not aware yet
but she's yours
she'll be saying, "use me
show me the jacuzzi"
i imagine that it's there on a plate
your whole rendezvous rate
means that you'll never be frightened
to make them wait for a while
i doubt it's your style
not to get what you set
out to acquire, the eyes are on fire
you are the unforecasted storm

(brian) calm, collected and commanding
(top marks for not trying)
you leave the other stories standing
with your renditions and jokes
bet there's hundreds of blokes
that have wept 'cause you've stolen their

thunder
are you putting us under
'cause we can't take our eyes
off the t-shirt and ties combination?

well, see you later, innovator
well, last night these two bouncers
and one of 'em's alright, the other one's the scary one
his way or no way, totalitarian
he's got no time for your looking or breathing
how he don't want you to, so step out the queue
he makes examples of you and there's nowt you can say
behind they go through to the bit where you pay
and you realize then that it's finally the time
to walk back past ten-thousand eyes in the line
and you can swap jumpers and make another move
instilled in your brain, you've got something to prove
to all the smirking faces and the boys in black
why can't they be pleasant? why can't they have a laugh?
he's got his hand in your chest, he wants to give you a duff
well, secretly i think they want you all to kick off
they want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well
it's just something to talk about, a story to tell, yeah

well, i'm so glad they turned us all away
we'll put it down to fate
i said a thousand million things
that i could never say this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

well, this town's a different town today
said, this town's a different town to what it was last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday
and that girl's a different girl today
said, that girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday
of course not

well, i'm so glad they turned us all away
we'll put it down to fate
i thought a thousand million things
that i could never think this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

last night, what we talked about
it made so much sense
but now the haze has ascended
it don't make no sense anymore
said, last night, what we talked about
it made so much sense
but now the haze has ascended
it don't make no sense anymore, oh

da-da, da-da-da
da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
he looks as if he hasn't slept
his hair is purposely unkept
and then he know his people wept
when you crafted your plan

shadows underneath the eyes
and everywhere the bastard lies
my lack of proof is your disguise
you won't remember me

there's nothing really i can say
but sorry mate and walk away
i could be wrong unless you play your game

this world is full of most unkind
and horrible is redefined
i can't imagine that you'd mind at all

you're lying again, you're conscience in your friend
and the only thing you're sorting out is your imagination
lying again, your conscience in your friend
and the only thing you're sorting out is your imagination

is he really on the street?
desperation or deceit?
and what he's wearing on his feet
won't solve our mystery

and i am baffled by
how you stand there, soaking it in
and do you hide your identity
where you hide your grin? better hide your grin

shadows underneath the eyes
everywhere the bastard lies
my lack of proof is your disguise
you won't remember me

there's nothing really i can say
but sorry mate and walk away
i could be wrong unless you play your game

this world is full of most unkind
and horrible is redefined
i can't imagine that you'd mind at all

you're lying again, your conscience in your friend
and the only thing you're sorting out is your imagination
lying again, conscience in your friend
and the only thing you're sorting out is your imagination

he knew what he wanted to say
but he did not want to word it
the dirty little herbert
was seeking an escape

d is for delightful

get on your dancing shoes
there's one thing on your mind
hoping they're looking for you
sure you'll be rummaging through

oh and the shit, shock, the horror
you've seen your future bride
yeah, but it's oh so absurd
for you to say the first word
so you're waiting and waiting and

the only reason that you came
so what you scared for
oh, don't you always do the same
it's what you there for, don't you know

the lights are flashing
down in here tonight
and some might exchange a glance
but keep pretending to dance

don't act like it's not happening
as if it's impolite
to go and mention your name
instead you'll just do the same
as they all do, and hope for the best

the only reason that you came
so what you scared for
well don't you always do the same
it's what you're there for but no

get on your dancing shoes
you sexy little swine
hoping they're looking for you
sure you'll be rummaging through

and i said the shit, shock, horror
you've seen your future bride, yeah
yeah, but it's oh so absurd
for you to say the first word
so you're waiting and waiting
i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination you're waitin', lyin' on your side
with your hands between your thighs

stop and wait a sec
when you look at me like that, my darlin'
what did you expect?
i probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
or i did last time i checked

not shy of a spark
the knife twists at the thought that i should fall short of the mark
or frightened by the bite though it's no harsher than the bark
the middle of adventure, seem like a perfect place to start

i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination you're waitin', lyin' on your side
with your hands between your thighs

alright

but i crumble completely when you cry
it seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
i'm always just about to go and spoil the surprise
take my hands off of your eyes too soon

i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive

1996 and i'm stuck at the bottom of a truck
on the run from the mi5, got detectives
and i'll say if you catch me that i really wish
that i had stayed (in gibraltar)

said, who's that girl there? 
i wonder what went wrong
so that she had to roam the streets
she don't do major credit cards
i doubt she does receipts
it's all not quite legitimate
and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes, yeah
that he's got a driving ban
amongst some other offences

and i've seen him with girls of the night
and he told roxanne to put on her red light
they're all infected but he'll be alright
'cause he's a scumbag, don't you know?
i said, he's a scumbag, don't you know?

although you're trying not to listen
avert your eyes and staring at the ground
she makes a subtle proposition
"i'm sorry, love, i'll have to turn you down"
and oh, he must be up to summat
what are the chances? sure it's more than likely
i've got a feeling in my stomach
and start to wonder what his story might be
what his story might be, yeah

'cause they said it changes when the sun goes down
yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here, around here, oh

and look here comes a ford mondeo
isn't he mister inconspicuous?
and he don't have to say 'owt
she's in the stance ready to get picked up
bet she's delighted when she sees him
pulling in and giving her the eye
because she must be fucking freezing
scantily-clad beneath the clear night sky
and don't stop in the winter, no

and they said it changes when the sun goes down
yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here

well, they said it changes when the sun goes down
over the river, going out of town
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here, around here, oh

and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes, yeah, that he's got a nasty plan
i hope you're not involved at all
fake tales of san francisco
echo through the room
more point to a wedding disco
without a bride or groom
and there's a super cool band, yeah
with their trilbies and their glasses of white wine
and all the weekend rock stars are in the toilet
practicing their lines

i don't want to hear you
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you, no
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you
i don't want to hear your

fake tales of san francisco
echo through the air
and there's a few bored faces at the back
all wishing they weren't there

and as the microphone squeaks
a young girl's telephone beeps
yeah, she's dashing for the exit
oh, she's running to the streets outside
"oh, you've saved me," she screams down the line
"the band were fucking wank
and i'm not having a nice time"

i don't want to hear you
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you, no
(kick me out, kick me out)

yeah, but his bird said it's amazing, though
so all that's left
is the proof that love's not only blind but deaf

he talks of san francisco, he's from hunter's bar
i don't quite know the distance
but i'm sure that's far
yeah i'm sure it's pretty far

and yeah, i'd love to tell you all my problem
you're not from new york city, you're from rotherham
so get off the bandwagon, and put down the handbook
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
well, it's ever so funny
'cause i don't think you're special, i don't think you're cool
you're just probably alright
but under these lights you look beautiful
and i'm struggling, i can't see through your fake tan
yeah, and you know it for a fact that everybody's eating out of your hands

but what do you know?
oh, you know nothing
yeah, but i'll still take you home
oh, yeah, i'll still take you home
so what do you know?
said, you don't know nothing

well, fancy seeing you in here
you're all tarted up and you don't look the same
well, i haven't seen you since last year
yeah, and surprisingly you have forgotten my name
but you know it, yeah, and you knew it all along
oh and you say you have forgotten
but you're fibbing, go on, tell me i'm wrong

so what do you know?
oh, you know nothing
yeah, but i'll still take you home
oh, yeah, i'll still take you home
so what do you know?
oh, you don't know nothing, no

oh-woah, woah, woah
oh-woah, woah, woah
da-da, da-da-da, da-da, da-da
da-da, da-da, da-da-da
oh-woah, woah, woah

oh, so what do you know?
yeah, you don't know nothing, no
yeah, but i'd still take you home
oh, yeah, i'll still take you home
i said, what do you know?
oh, you don't know nothing

i fancy you with a passion
oh, you're a topshop princess, a rockstar, too
but you're a fad and you're a fashion
and i'm having a job trying to talk to you
but it's alright, yeah, i'll put it on one side
oh, 'cause everybody's looking, you've got control of everyone's eyes
including mine
this house is a circus, berserk as f*ck
we tend to see that as a perk, though look 
what it's done to your friends
their memories are pretend
and the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
this house is a circus, berserk as f*ck
we tend to see that as a perk, though look
what it's done to your friends
their memories are pretend
and the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end

there's a room full of trouble and there's lovers to be had
those ones who make sinners out of such lovely lads
scaling the corridors for maidens in the maze
and any anomaly is slipping into familiar ways
and we're forever unfulfilled and can't think why
like a search for murder clues in dead man's eyes
forever unfulfilled and can't think why
like a search for murder clues in dead man's eyes

the more you open your mouth, the more you're forcing performance
and all the attention is leading me to feel important
(gimme obnoxious, gimme obnoxious now)
now that we're here, we may as well go too far

wriggling around in incidents you won't forget
there's certainly some venom in the looks that you collect
aimlessly gazing at the faces in the queue
and we're struggling with the notion that it's life, not film

this house is a circus, berserk as f*ck (we're forever unfulfilled)
we tend to see that as a perk, though look (can't think why)
what it's done to your friends
their memories are pretend (like a search for murder clues)
and the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
take a little walk to the edge of town and go across the tracks
where the viaduct looms like a bird of doom as it shifts and cracks
where secrets lie in the border fires in the humming wires
well, you know you're never coming back

past the square, past the bridge, past the mills, past the stacks
on a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man
in a dusty black coat with a red right hand

he'll wrap you in his arms and tell you that you've been a good boy
he'll rekindle all the dreams it took you a lifetime to destroy
he'll reach deep into the hole, heal your shrinking soul
and there won't be a single thing that you can do

he's a god, he's a man, he's a ghost, he's a guru
they're whispering his name 'cross this disappearing land
but hidden in his coat is a red right hand

you don't have no money? he'll get you some
if you haven't got no car, he'll get you one
you've got no self-respect, you feel like an insect
well, don't you worry, buddy, 'cause here he comes
through the ghettos and the barrows and the bowery and the slum
a shadow is cast wherever he stands
stacks of green paper in his red right hand

you'll see him in your nightmares, you'll see him in your dreams
he'll appear out of nowhere, but he's not what he seems
you'll see him in your head on the tv screen
hey, buddy, i'm warning you to turn it off

he's a ghost, he's a god, he's a man, he's a guru
you're one microscopic cog in his catastrophic plan
designed and directed by his red right hand

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah, regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen
the lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
of course it's fancy dress
and they're all looking quite forlorn in bunny ears and devil horns and how

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah, regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen

i wanna see you take the jackpot out the fruit machine
and put it all back in
you've got to understand that you can never beat the bandit, no

and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
when she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
and there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
and all that is said is that you've drank a lot

and you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind, yeah
you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind

and you can pour your heart out
for a reason it would block
oh, you send her after nine o'clock

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah, regardless of what's gone before

and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
when she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock

and all that is said is that you've drank a lot

and you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind, yeah
you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind

and you can pour your heart out
around three o'clock
when the two-for-ones have done the writer's block




well, the morning was complete
where there was tears on the steering wheel, dripping on the seat
several hours or several weeks
i'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak

it's the beginning of the end 
the car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend
ask anyone, they'll tell you
that it's these times that it tends
to start to break in half, to start to fall apart
hold on to your heart

and do me a favor and break my nose
or do me a favor and tell me to go away
or do me a favor and stop asking questions

well, she walked away while her shoes were untied 
when the eyes were all red
you could see that we'd cried 
and i watched, and i waited 'til she was inside
forcing a smile and waving goodbye

curiosity becomes a heavy load
too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
curiosity becomes a heavy load
too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold

and do me a favor, and ask, if you need some help
she said, do me a favor, and stop flattering yourself
and to tear apart the ties that bind
perhaps "f*ck off" might be too kind
perhaps "f*ck off" might be too kind
they've sped up to the point where they provoke
the punchline before they have told the joke
plenty desperation to be seen
staring at the television screen
they've sped up to the point where they provoke
you to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke
well sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
it wasn't in the top 100 list

and it's the thousandth time that's it's even bolder
don't be surprised when you get bent over
they told ya, but you were dying for it

she saw it, and she grabbed it, and it wasn't what it seemed
the kids all dream of making it, whatever that means
another variation on a theme
a tangle on the television and the magazine
do you reckon that they do it for a joke?
do you reckon that they make 'em take an oath
that says that we are defenders
of any poseur or professional pretender around

when did your list replace the twist and turn
like a fist replaced the kiss?
don't concern us with your bollocks, i don't want your prayer
save it for the morning after

and it's the thousandth time that's it's even bolder
don't be surprised when you get bent over
they told ya, but you were dying for it

let's have a game on the teddy picker
not quick enough, can i have it quicker?
already thick and you're getting thicker
let's have a game on the teddy picker
not quick enough, can i have it quicker?
already thick and you're getting thicker

presuming that all things are equal
who'd want to be men of the people
when there's people like you?
you used to get it in your fishnets
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
landed in a very common crisis
everything's in order in a black hole
nothing seems as pretty as the past though
that bloody mary's lacking in tabasco
remember when he used to be a rascal?

oh, the boy's a slag
the best you ever had
the best you ever had
is just a memory and those dreams
weren't as daft as they seem
not as daft as they seemed
my love, when you dream them up

flicking through a little book of sex tips
remember when the boys were all electric?
now, when she tells she's gonna get it
i'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
clinging to not getting sentimental
said, she wasn't going, but she went, still
likes her gentlemen to not be gentle
was it a mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

oh, the boy's a slag
the best you ever had
the best you ever had
is just a memory and those dreams
weren't as daft as they seem
not as daft as they seemed
my love, when you dream them up
oh, flo, where did you go?
where did you go?
where did you go? oh oh

you're falling about
you took a left off last laugh lane
just soundin' it out
but you're not coming back again

you're falling about
you took a left off last laugh lane
you were just soundin' it out
but you're not coming back again

you used to get it in your fishnets (falling about)
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness (you took a left off last laugh lane)
landed in a very common crisis
everything's in order in a black hole (were sounding it out)
is everything as pretty as the past though?
that bloody mary's lacking in tabasco (you're not coming back again)
remember when he used to be a rascal? oh
said, who's that girl there? 
i wonder what went wrong
so that she had to roam the streets
she don't do major credit cards
i doubt she does receipts
it's all not quite legitimate
and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes, yeah
that he's got a driving ban
amongst some other offences

and i've seen him with girls of the night
and he told roxanne to put on her red light
they're all infected but he'll be alright
'cause he's a scumbag, don't you know?
i said, he's a scumbag, don't you know?

although you're trying not to listen
avert your eyes and staring at the ground
she makes a subtle proposition
"i'm sorry, love, i'll have to turn you down"
and oh, he must be up to summat
what are the chances? sure it's more than likely
i've got a feeling in my stomach
and start to wonder what his story might be
what his story might be, yeah

'cause they said it changes when the sun goes down
yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here, around here, oh

and look here comes a ford mondeo
isn't he mister inconspicuous?
and he don't have to say 'owt
she's in the stance ready to get picked up
bet she's delighted when she sees him
pulling in and giving her the eye
because she must be fucking freezing
scantily-clad beneath the clear night sky
and don't stop in the winter, no

and they said it changes when the sun goes down
yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here

well, they said it changes when the sun goes down
over the river, going out of town
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here, around here, oh

and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes, yeah, that he's got a nasty plan
i hope you're not involved at all
have you got color in your cheeks?
do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
that sticks around like summat in your teeth?
are there some aces up your sleeve?
have you no idea that you're in deep?
i've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
how many secrets can you keep?
'cause there's this tune i found
that makes me think of you somehow and i play it on repeat
until i fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

(do i wanna know?) if this feelin' flows both ways?
(sad to see you go) was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(baby, we both know) that the nights were mainly made
for sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

crawlin' back to you
ever thought of callin' when
you've had a few?
'cause i always do
maybe i'm too
busy bein' yours
to fall for somebody new
now, i've thought it through
crawlin' back to you

so have you got the guts?
been wonderin' if your heart's still open
and if so, i wanna know what time it shuts
simmer down an' pucker up, i'm sorry to interrupt
it's just i'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
i don't know if you feel the same as i do
but we could be together if you wanted to

(do i wanna know?) if this feelin' flows both ways?
(sad to see you go) was sorta hopin' that you'd stay

last night these two bouncers
and one of 'em's alright, the other one's the scary one
his way or no way, totalitarian
he's got no time for your looking or breathing
how he don't want you to, so step out the queue
he makes examples of you and there's nowt you can say
behind they go through to the bit where you pay
and you realize then that it's finally the time
to walk back past ten-thousand eyes in the line
and you can swap jumpers and make another move
instilled in your brain, you've got something to prove
to all the smirking faces and the boys in black
why can't they be pleasant? why can't they have a laugh?
he's got his hand in your chest, he wants to give you a duff
well, secretly i think they want you all to kick off
they want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well
it's just something to talk about, a story to tell, yeah

well, i'm so glad they turned us all away
we'll put it down to fate
i said a thousand million things
that i could never say this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

well, this town's a different town today
said, this town's a different town to what it was last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday
and that girl's a different girl today
and that girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday
of course not

well, i'm so glad they turned us all away
we'll put it down to fate
i thought a thousand million things
that i could never think this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

it don't make no sense anymore

why can't they be pleasant? why can't they have a laugh?
he's got his hand in your chest, he wants to give you a duff
well, secretly i think they want you all to kick off
they want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well
it's just something to talk about, a story to tell, yeah

well, i'm so glad they turned us all away
we'll put it down to fate
i said a thousand million things
that i could never say this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

well, this town's a different town today
said, this town's a different town to what it was last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday
and that girl's a different girl today
said, that girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday
of course not

well, i'm so glad they turned us all away
we'll put it down to fate
i thought a thousand million things
that i could never think this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

last night, what we talked about
it made so much sense
but now the haze has ascended
it don't make no sense anymore
said, last night, what we talked about
it made so much sense
but now the haze has ascended
it don't make no sense anymore, oh

da-da, da-da-da

brian
top marks for not trying
so kind of you to bless us
with your effortlessness
we're grateful and so strangely comforted
and i wonder
are you putting us under
'cause we can't take our eyes
off the t-shirt and ties combination?
well, see you later, innovator

some want to kiss, some want to kick you
there's not a net you couldn't slip through
or at least that's the impression i get
'cause you're smooth, and you're wet
and she's not aware yet
but she's yours
she'll be saying, "use me
show me the jacuzzi"
i imagine that it's there on a plate
your whole rendezvous rate
means that you'll never be frightened
to make them wait for a while
i doubt it's your style
not to get what you set
out to acquire, the eyes are on fire
you are the unforecasted storm

(brian) calm, collected and commanding
(top marks for not trying)
you leave the other stories standing
with your renditions and jokes
bet there's hundreds of blokes
that have wept 'cause you've stolen their

thunder
are you putting us under
'cause we can't take our eyes
off the t-shirt and ties combination?

well, see you later, innovator
fake tales of san francisco
echo through the room
more point to a wedding disco
without a bride or groom
and there's a super cool band, yeah
with their trilbies and their glasses of white wine
and all the weekend rock stars are in the toilet
practicing their lines

i don't want to hear you
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you, no
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you
i don't want to hear your

fake tales of san francisco
echo through the air
and there's a few bored faces at the back
all wishing they weren't there

and as the microphone squeaks
a young girl's telephone beeps
yeah, she's dashing for the exit
oh, she's running to the streets outside
"oh, you've saved me," she screams down the line
"the band were fucking wank
and i'm not having a nice time"

i don't want to hear you
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you, no
(kick me out, kick me out)

yeah, but his bird said it's amazing, though
so all that's left
is the proof that love's not only blind but deaf

he talks of san francisco, he's from hunter's bar
i don't quite know the distance
but i'm sure that's far
yeah i'm sure it's pretty far

and yeah, i'd love to tell you all my problem
you're not from new york city, you're from rotherham
so get off the bandwagon, and put down the handbook
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
you used to get it in your fishnets
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
landed in a very common crisis
everything's in order in a black hole
nothing seems as pretty as the past though
that bloody mary's lacking in tabasco
remember when he used to be a rascal?

oh, the boy's a slag
the best you ever had
the best you ever had
is just a memory and those dreams
weren't as daft as they seem
not as daft as they seemed
my love, when you dream them up

flicking through a little book of sex tips
remember when the boys were all electric?
now, when she tells she's gonna get it
i'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
clinging to not getting sentimental
said, she wasn't going, but she went, still
likes her gentlemen to not be gentle
was it a mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

oh, the boy's a slag
the best you ever had
the best you ever had
is just a memory and those dreams
weren't as daft as they seem
not as daft as they seemed
my love, when you dream them up
oh, flo, where did you go?
where did you go?
where did you go? oh oh

you're falling about
you took a left off last laugh lane
just soundin' it out
but you're not coming back again

you're falling about
you took a left off last laugh lane
you were just soundin' it out
but you're not coming back again

you used to get it in your fishnets (falling about)
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness (you took a left off last laugh lane)
landed in a very common crisis
everything's in order in a black hole (were sounding it out)
is everything as pretty as the past though?
that bloody mary's lacking in tabasco (you're not coming back again)
remember when he used to be a rascal? oh
007 and brucey wayne
are shitting there 'selves because there's another name coming to claim
what is his to claim
10% faster with a sturdier frame

he's certainly come into his own
there's one on his arm in every land that he roams
and two consecutive nights alone
are a thing of the past as he has recently shown

they said he looks so handsome stood not dancing
drawing you in like it's boring to him
it's a war you can't win and the first and the last are two things you'll never
be my darling

another roll around and another push and shove
further away from the idea of love
and his conclusion it must be good
oh wouldn't the penny would drop with an incredible thud
they forgot to kick the tin, he knows where she's going
but don't know where she's been
and as opposed to the other thing
he'll worry about it when it's trouble he's in

they said he looks so handsome stood not dancing
drawing you in like it's boring to him
it's a war you can't win and the first and the last are two
things you'll never be my darling

things you'll never be my darling

(two things you will never be my darling)

(two things you'll never be my darling)

well they sneered and sniffed and spat at my chat up lines
not to feel like a twat at times is hard
(but not for this kid, not when they come to you)
anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah, regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen
the lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
of course it's fancy dress
and they're all looking quite forlorn in bunny ears and devil horns and how

and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
when she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
and there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
and all that is said is that you've drank a lot

around three o'clock
when the two-for-ones have done the writer's block
have you got color in your cheeks?
do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
that sticks around like summat in your teeth?
are there some aces up your sleeve?
have you no idea that you're in deep?
i've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
how many secrets can you keep?
'cause there's this tune i found
that makes me think of you somehow and i play it on repeat
until i fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

(do i wanna know?) if this feelin' flows both ways?
(sad to see you go) was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(baby, we both know) that the nights were mainly made
for sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

crawlin' back to you
ever thought of callin' when
you've had a few?
'cause i always do
maybe i'm too
busy bein' yours
to fall for somebody new
now, i've thought it through
crawlin' back to you

so have you got the guts?
been wonderin' if your heart's still open
and if so, i wanna know what time it shuts
simmer down an' pucker up, i'm sorry to interrupt
it's just i'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
i don't know if you feel the same as i do
but we could be together if you wanted to

(do i wanna know?) if this feelin' flows both ways?
(sad to see you go) was sorta hopin' that you'd stay

i'm a puppet on a string
tracy island, time-traveling
diamond cutter-shaped heartaches
come to find you four in some velvet morning
years too late, she's a silver lining
lone ranger riding through an open space
in my mind when she's not right there beside me

i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself, all i
wanna hear her say is "are you mine?"
well, are you mine?
are you mine?
are you mine? oh, ah

i guess what i'm tryna say is i need the deep end
keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
unfair, we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
great escape, lost track of time and space
she's a silver lining climbing on my desire

and i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself, all i
wanna hear her say is "are you mine?"
well, are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
are you mine? (or just mine tonight?)
are you mine? (are you mine?)
oh ah

and the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
so in case, i'm mistaken, i
just wanna hear you say, "you got me, baby, are you mine?"

she's a silver lining
lone ranger riding through an open space
that's a big shadow

in my mind when she's not right there beside me
i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself, all i
wanna hear her say is "are you mine?"
well, are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
are you mine? (or just mine tonight?)
are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
oh ah (or just mine tonight?)

outside the cafe by the cracker factory
you were practicing a magic trick
and my thoughts got rude, as you talked and chewed
on the last of your pick and mix

said, "you're mistaken if you're thinking that i haven't been called "cold" before"
as you bit into your strawberry lace
and then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
is all you had left and it was going to waste

your pastimes, consisted of the strange
and twisted and deranged
and i love that little game you had called
"crying lightning"
and how you like to aggravate the ice-cream man on rainy afternoons

the next time that i caught my own reflection
it was on it's way to meet you
thinking of excuses to postpone
you never looked like yourself from the side
but your profile could not hide
the fact you knew i was approaching your throne

with folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
stood and puffed your chest out like you never lost a war
and though i tried so not to suffer the indignity of a reaction
there was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

and your pastimes, consisted of the strange
and twisted and deranged
and i hate that little game you had called
"crying lightning"
and how you like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons

uninviting
but not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are
crying lightning

and your pastimes, consisted of the strange
and twisted and deranged
and i hate that little game you had called
"crying lightning"
"crying lightning", oh
"crying lightning"
"crying lightning"

your pastimes, consisted of the strange
and twisted and deranged
and i hate that little game you had called
"crying"
we are arctic monkeys and this is 
"i bet you look good on the dancefloor"
don't believe the hype

stop making the eyes at me
i'll stop making the eyes at you
what it is that surprises me
is that i don't really want you to

and your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
your name isn't rio, but i don't like the sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
from 1984

i wish you'd stop ignoring me
because you're sending me to despair
without a sound, yeah, you're calling me
and i don't think it's very fair

your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
your name isn't rio, but i don't like the sand

oh, there ain't no love, no montagues or capulets
just banging tunes and dj sets and
dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness
oh, come back

well, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for

but just manage to miss the mark

ooh-ooh
good afternoon
tranquility base hotel and casino
mark speaking

feels as if it really might catch on
mama wants some answers

technological advances

kiss me underneath the moon's side boob

good afternoon
tranquility base hotel and casino

when the two-for-ones have done the writer's block, woah

i've got just one more question for you
trudging through the morning
the tramp with the trampoline under his arm
shifts past your whiskers
so stark is a charm but the barking alarm
waits coiled 'til the corner is turned

and the bicycle wheels all struggle to move 'round
in your muddy mind, blatantly caked
and unwilling to wind uncooperative time
so she sits on the springs 'til the muck goes dry 

ooh

all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast
the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast
the shadow of a snake pit on the

what came first, the chicken or the dickhead?
split sleep reaps rewards from ill-fitting thoughts
a twilight force, she doesn't wanna walk
your legs start running and your leg gets caught
canopy 19 is perfectly placed for the reasonably frightening
fall from the aftertaste, you'll have to slip away
i am unhappy to say
behold as the crook in the hammock plays

all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast
the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast
the shadow of a snake pit on the wall

let's play darts

behold as a crook in the hammock plays
cruelly with the base and the scales
and fiddles with her feet on a balancing act
gagged, bound and crafting a tale
trailing wrapped in a gasp

cruelly with the base and the scales
and fucking fiddles with her feet on a balancing act
she was gagged, bound and crafting a tale
trailing wrapped in a gasp

all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast
the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast

fiendish wonder in the carnival's wake 
dull caresses once again irritate
tread softly, stranger 
move over toward the danger that you seek 

you think excitement has receded then the mirror distracts
the logic of the trance quickly reaches and grasps
handsome and faceless
and weightless, your imagination runs

and now it's no one's fault but yours 
at the foot of the house of cards 
you thought you'd never get obsessed 
you thought the wolves would be impressed 
and you're a sinking stone 
but you know what it's like to hold the jeweler's hands 
that procession of pioneers all drowned 

in the moonlight they're more thrilling 
those things that he knows 
as he leads you through the grinning 
bubble blowers in the snow 
watching his exit 
was like falling off the ferry in the night 

the inevitables gather to push you around 
any other voice makes such a punishing sound
he became laughter's assassin 
shortly after he showed you what it was 

and now it's no one's fault but yours 
at the foot of the house of cards 
you thought you'd never get obsessed 
you thought the wolves would be impressed 
and you're a sinking stone 
but you know what it's like to hold the jeweler's hands 
that procession of pioneers all drowned 

if you've a lesson to teach me
i'm listening, ready to learn 
there's no one here to police me
i'm sinking in until you return 

if you've a lesson to teach
please don't deviate, don't be afraid 
without the last corner piece, i can't calibrate
let's get it ingrained

when you left the house this evening
you said you'd be back in a little while
but i've been waiting for such a long time
and this waiting is driving me wild

and while i wait, i think about you
do you need me and i'm not there?
are you planning to be without me?
do you have a new affair?

you're a bad, bad woman
you're a bad, bad woman

pictures of you keep flashing through my mind
if you would only call, if you would be so kind
imagine things, i see another man
and it's this waiting i just can't stand

you're a bad, bad woman
you're a bad, bad woman
you're a bad, bad woman
you're a bad, bad woman
show us your special move
swinging room to room
planting something new
i've ridden the riddle, i'll do it again
back to the wirral where it all began

wirral riddler

send a letter to me, baby
i'm on the edge of my seat
send a letter to me, baby
little illusion machine

riding through the gloom
something beautiful

he's going back to the wirral where it all began

wirral riddler

send a letter to me, baby
i'm on the edge of my seat
send a letter to me, baby
little illusion machine

i tried it and i liked it but
it just never gets close enough

send a letter to me, baby

(wirral)
so tell me where have you been?
(wirral)
little illusion machine
(wirral)
hoping tonight is going to send me back to you

wow!
well, this is a good idea
he wouldn't do it if it wasn't
he wouldn't do it if it wasn't one
well, my friend fancies you
oh, what a way to begin it all
you said, "they're always exciting words to hear"
and they woke up together not quite realizing how
awkwardly stretching and yawning
it's always hard in the morning

and i suppose that's the price you pay
well, oh, it isn't what it was
she's thinking he looks different today
and now there's nothing left to guess now

they left before the lights came on
because they didn't want to ruin what it was that was brewing
before they absolutely had to
and how can you wake up with someone you don't love
and not feel slightly fazed by it?
oh, he had a struggle
and they woke up together not quite realizing how

awkwardly stretching and yawning
it's always hard in the morning

and i suppose that's the price you pay
well, oh, it isn't what it was
she's thinking he looks different today
and now there's nothing left to guess now

well, quick, let's leave before the lights come on
'cause then you don't have to see
'cause then you don't have to see what you've done
well, quick, let's leave before the lights come on
'cause then you don't have to see
'cause then you don't have to see what you've done

been wonderin' if your heart's still open
and if so, i wanna know what time it shuts
simmer down an' pucker up, i'm sorry to interrupt
it's just i'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
i don't know if you feel the same as i do
but we could be together if you wanted to

(do i wanna know?) if this feelin' flows both ways?
(sad to see you go) was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(baby, we both know) that the nights were mainly made
for sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

crawlin' back to you (crawlin' back to you)

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah, regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen
the lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
of course it's fancy dress
and they're all looking quite forlorn in bunny ears and devil horns and how

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah, regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen

i wanna see you take the jackpot out the fruit machine
and put it all back in
you've got to understand that you can never beat the bandit, no

and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
when she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
and there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
and all that is said is that you've drank a lot

and you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind, yeah
you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind

and you can pour your heart out
for a reason it would block
oh, you send her after nine o'clock

and you can pour your heart out
around three o'clock
when the two-for-ones have done the writer's block
one, two, three, four (roll that faster, man)
one, two, three, four (oh, we gotta time that)
(the whole point of a count is that it's in time, in it?)
one, two, three, four

well, i watch you tangle every weekend
it might start different but it ends up the same
one minute, you're casually speaking
the next it all goes up and you pour fuel on the flame
with your jerry can of words and tones

and no one's gonna start a revolution
so we best leave it well alone
and there's something that frankie used to say
apparently

oh, he said, settle for a draw
well, you're not gonna get no more
so you should settle for a draw
i told you once i'm sure, i told you once i'm sure
you should settle for a draw
why don't you settle for a draw?

well, you're right, it is one set of rules for her
and then another set for you
but that's just the way it is, i suppose
and there's nowt you can do
and let's not fall in the trap of answering back
i am just a beginner but she'll be the only winner
that's for sure, so take the draw, if it's available
and if it sets on fire
don't get out your jerry can of words and tones

and no one's gonna start a revolution
so we best leave it well alone
and there's something that frankie used to say
apparently

oh, he said, settle for a draw
well, you're not gonna get no more
so you should settle for the draw
i told you once i'm sure, i told you once i'm sure
you should settle for a draw

i thought i saw you in the battleship
but it was only a look alike
she was nothing but a vision trick
under the warning light
she was close
close enough to be your ghost
but my chances turned to toast
when i asked her if i could call her your name

i thought i saw you in the rusty hook
huddled up in wicker chair
i wandered up for a closer look
and kissed whoever was sitting there
she was close
and she held me very tightly
'til i asked awfully politely
"please, can i call you her name?"

and i elongated my lift home
yeah, i let him go the long way 'round
i smelt your scent on the seatbelt
and kept my shortcuts to myself

i thought i saw you in the parrot's beak
messin' with the smoke alarm
it was too loud for me to hear her speak
and she had a broken arm
it was close
so close that the walls were wet
and she wrote it out in letraset
"no, you can't call me her name"

tell me, where's your hiding place?
i'm worried i'll forget your face
and i've asked everyone
i'm beginning to think i imagined you all along

i elongated my lift home
yeah, i let him go the long way 'round
i smelt your scent on the seatbelt
and kept my shortcuts to myself

i saw your sister in the cornerstone
on the phone to the middle man
when i saw that she was on her own
i thought she might understand
that she was close
well, you couldn't get much closer
she said, "i'm really not supposed to, but yes
you can call me anything you want"
007 and brucey wayne
are shitting there 'selves because there's another name coming to claim
what is his to claim
10% faster with a sturdier frame

he's certainly come into his own
there's one on his arm in every land that he roams
and two consecutive nights alone
are a thing of the past as he has recently shown

they said he looks so handsome stood not dancing
drawing you in like it's boring to him
it's a war you can't win and the first and the last are two things you'll never
be my darling

another roll around and another push and shove
further away from the idea of love
and his conclusion it must be good
oh wouldn't the penny would drop with an incredible thud
they forgot to kick the tin, he knows where she's going
but don't know where she's been
and as opposed to the other thing
he'll worry about it when it's trouble he's in

they said he looks so handsome stood not dancing
drawing you in like it's boring to him
it's a war you can't win and the first and the last are two
things you'll never be my darling

things you'll never be my darling

(two things you will never be my darling)

(two things you'll never be my darling)

well they sneered and sniffed and spat at my chat up lines
not to feel like a twat at times is hard
(but not for this kid, not when they come to you)
i like the way you look at me baby
please don't try and turn on the lights
i act as if i'm not going crazy
girl i'm in a muddle tonight
would you tell me where you're gonna take it
if i had a heart you're the one who should break it
the engines running, can't decide if i should ride away

you and i
you and i

i had a woman, she went away
and now i'm lonely, f*ck it

you and i
you and i

you and i
you and i

would you tell me where you're gonna take it
if i had a heart you're the one who should break it

the engines running, can't decide if i should ride away
you and i
you and i

you and i
you and i

you and i
you and i

i like the way you look at me baby
please don't go and turn out the lights
i act as if i'm not going crazy
girl, i'm in a muddle tonight
sketchead is coming to your party
he's walking up your drive and he's swinging all his keys around
sketchead, he's seen you with your top off
he already knows your boyfriend, retain your introductions
sketchead, that cumbersome protagonist
the pips in your quince, the eye behind the spy hole
the itch you can't itch in your ear
and the knock that shattered your packet of peppermints

sketchead, there's poison in his spit
he'll compliment your tits and leave you to your wits
sketchead, convincingly insisting
the tires were bald when you gave him the car
sketchead, still coming to your party
still walking up your drive and still swinging all his keys around
on his finger as a pendulum to unnerve

and then there's you, you've changed
i approached you like you were the same
but soon it was apparent a new name was required
new lips went and fired accomplishments at me
while i'm captivated by your magazine skin
the tint on your lenses obscures to begin
and you know full well
that anyone who says that they don't prefer the sequel
will still be swinging on themselves tonight
she was marrying a matador and he was with the weather girl
a very clever girl who stood out among several once
a terrible dilemma and forever he'll regret this day he didn't make the
rescue from the bull ring
sulking won't get you nowhere son
there's blood on your chin where you've bitten your tongue
smitten but might not be smitten for long if you're still sitting she'll soon
be smitten and gone
been fighting with my sheets
and nearly crying in my sleep
yes, i'm battling that well taught gripe
the most restraining type
you should have racing stripes

the way you keep me in pursuit
sharpen the heel of your boot
and you press it to my chest and you make me wheeze
then to my knees you do promote me

i'm pinned down by the dark
a-n-i-m-a-l
makes my head pirouette
more than i won't be willing to confess
d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s

the light it fidgets through
the thoughts'll soon revert to you
about as bashful as a tribal dance
the first and final chance
and cause the audience

the frighteners and fiends
divided up into two teams
when the acrobat fell off the beam
she broke everyone's hearts

i'm pinned down by the dark
a-n-i-m-a-l
makes my head pirouette
more than i would be willing to confess
d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s

d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s
the most unsuitable pet
it's been long enough now so let's
make a mess lioness

pinned down by the dark
i'm pinned down by the dark

d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s
a-n-i-m-a-l
d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s
a-n-i-m-a-l
the mirror's image
it tells me it's home time
but i'm not finished
'cause you're not by my side

and as i arrived i thought i saw you leaving
carrying your shoes
decided that once again i was just dreaming
of bumping into you

now it's three in the morning
and i'm trying to change your mind
left you multiple missed calls
and to my message you reply
why'd you only call me when you're high?
high
why'd you only call me when you're high?

somewhere darker
talking the same shite
i need a partner
well are you out tonight?

it's harder and harder to get you to listen
more i get through the gears
incapable of making alright decisions
and having bad ideas

now it's three in the morning
and i'm trying to change your mind
left you multiple missed calls
and to my message you reply
(message you reply)
why'd you only call me when you're high?
(why'd you only call me when you're)
high
why'd you only call me when you're high?

and i can't see you here when i'm high
sort of feels like i'm running out of time
i haven't found all i was hoping to find
you said you got to be up in the morning
gonna have an early night
and you starting to bore me, baby
why'd you only call me when you're high?

why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?

why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
open sesame. (we've places to go)
we've people to see. (let's put 'em on hold)
there's all sorts of shapes, that i bet you can make
when you want to escape say the word

well i know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
with the exception of you i dislike everyone in the room
and i don't wanna lie, but i don't wanna tell you the truth
get the sense that you're on the move
and you'll probably be leaving soon, so i'm telling you

stop the world 'cause i wanna, get off, with you
stop the world 'cause i wanna, get off, with you.

eyes the colour of, (water left in mud)
icing sugar dust. (crazy green flashes)
it's a funny thing, that i cannot explain
don't you know the train keeps a-rolling?

stop the world cause i wanna, get off, with you
stop the world cause i wanna, get off, with you.

well i know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
and i don't wanna lie, and i don't wanna tell you the truth
and i know we got places to go, we got people to see
think we both oughta put 'em on hold and i know you agree

stop the world 'cause i wanna, get off, with you
stop the world 'cause i wanna, get off, with you.
i just wanted to be one of the strokes
now look at the mess you made me make
hitchhiking with a monogrammed suitcase
miles away from any half-useful imaginary highway
i'm a big name in deep space
ask your mates but golden boy's in bad shape
i found out the hard way
that here ain't no place for dolls like you and me
everybody's on a barge
floating down the endless stream of great tv
1984, 2019

maybe i was a little too wild in the 70s
rocket-ship grease down the cracks of my knuckles
karate bandana
warp speed chic
hair down to there
impressive moustache
love came in a bottle with a twist off cap
let's all have a swig and do a hot lap

so who you gonna call?
the martini police
baby, that isn't how they look tonight, oh no
it took the light forever to get to your eyes

i just wanted to be one of those ghosts
you thought that you could forget
and then i haunt you via the rear view mirror
on a long drive from the back seat
but it's alright 'cause you love me
and you recognize that it ain't how it should be
your eyes are heavy and the weather's getting ugly
so pull over, i know the place
don't you know an apparition is a cheap date?
what exactly is it you've been drinking these days?
jukebox in the corner
long hot summer
they've got a film up on the wall and it's dark enough to dance
what do you mean you've never seen blade runner?

oh, maybe i was a little too wild in the 70s
back down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer
elevator down to my make believe residency
from the honeymoon suite
two shows a day, four nights a week
easy money

so who you gonna call?
the martini police
so who you gonna call?
the martini police
baby, that isn't how they look tonight
it took the light absolutely forever to get to your eyes

and as we gaze skyward, ain't it dark early?
it's the star treatment, yeah
and as we gaze skyward, ain't it dark early?
it's the star treatment
it's the star treatment
the star treatment
dancing in my underpants
i'm gonna run for government
i'm gonna form a covers band and all
and back there by the baby grand
did mr. winter wonderland say
"come here, kid, we really need to talk"?
bear with me, man, i lost my train of thought

i fantasize, i call it quits
i swim with the economists
and i get to the bottom of it for good
by the time reality hits
the chimes of freedom fell to bits
the shining city on the fritz
they come out of the cracks
thirsty for blood

just as the apocalypse finally gets prioritized
and you cried some of the hottest tears you ever cried
multiplied by five
i suppose the singer must die

singsong 'round the money tree
this stunning documentary
that no one else unfortunately saw
such beautiful photography
it's worth it for the opening scene
i've been driving 'round listening to the score
or maybe, i just imagined it all
i've played to quiet rooms like this before
bear with me, man, i lost my train of thought
so when you gaze at planet earth from outer space
does it wipe that stupid look off of your face?
i saw this aura over the battleground states
i lost the money, lost the keys
but i'm still handcuffed to the briefcase

and i never thought, not in a million years
that i'd meet so many lovers
can i please have my money back?
my virtual reality mask is stuck on "parliament brawl"
emergency battery pack just in time
for my weekly chat with god on video call

breaking news, they take the truth and make it and fluid
the trainer's explanation was accepted by the steward
a montage of the latest ancient ruins
soundtracked by a chorus of "you don't know what you're doing"

and i never thought, not in a million years
that i'd meet so many lovers

and all of my most muscular regrets explode
behind my eyes like american sports

and i never thought, not in a million years
that i'd meet so many lovers

last night when my psyche's
subcommittee sang to me in its scary voice
you slowly dropped your eyelids
when true love takes a grip it leaves you without a choice

and in response to what you whispered in my ear
i must admit sometimes i fantasize about you, too

the leader of the free world
reminds you of a wrestler wearing tight golden trunks
he's got himself a theme tune
they play it for him as he makes his way to the ring

and in response to what you whispered in my ear
i must admit sometimes i fantasize about you, too

in the daytime
bendable figures with a fresh new pack of lies
summat else to publicise
i'm sure you've heard about enough

so in response to what you whispered in my ear
i'll be upfront, sometimes (sometimes) i fantasize about you, too
advertise in imaginative ways
start your free trial today
come on in, the water's lovely
look, you could meet someone you like
during the meteor strike
it is that easy
lunar surface on a saturday night
dressed up in silver and white
with coloured old grey whistle test lights

take it easy for a little while
come and stay with us
it's such an easy flight
cute new places keep on popping up
since the exodus it's all getting gentrified
i put a taqueria on the roof
it was well reviewed
four stars out of five
and that's unheard of

i'm mr. bridge and tunnel on the starlight express
the head of special effects in my mind's eye
okey cokey with the opposite sex
the things you try to forget
doesn't time fly?
i'm in no position to give advice
i don't want to be nice
and you know that

take it easy for a little while
come and stay with us
it's such an easy flight
cute new places keep popping up
around clavius
it's all getting gentrified
the information action ratio
is the place to go
and you will not recognize
the old headquarters

all the nights that never happened
and the days that don't exist
at the information action ratio
only time that we stop laughing
is to breathe or steal a kiss
i can get you on the list for all the clubs
i can lift you up another semitone

take it easy for a little while
(take it easy for a little while)
come and stay with us
it's such an easy flight
cute new places keep on popping up
(cute new places keep on popping up)

that's the best thing for it
you push the button and we'll do the rest

she looks like fun
she looks like fun
she looks like fun
she looks like

smile like you've got a straw in something tropical
i've got the party plugged right into my skull
wayne manor, what a memorable n.y.e

(she looks like fun)
good morning
(she looks like fun)
cheeseburger
(she looks like fun)
snowboarding
(she looks like)

finally, i can share with you through cloudy skies
every whimsical thought that enters my mind
there's no limit to the length of the dickheads we can be

(she looks like fun)
bukowski
(she looks like fun)
dogsitting
(she looks like fun)
screwballing
(she looks like)

finally, there's a place where you can wag your tongue
baby, but why can't we all just get along?
dance as if somebody's watching, 'cause they are

no one's on the streets
we moved it all online
as of march
i'm so full of shite
i need to spend less time stood around in bars
waffling on to strangers all about martial arts
and how much i respect them

(she looks like fun)
key changes
(she looks like fun)
re-thinking
(she looks like fun)
new order
(she looks like fun)
i want an interesting synonym
to describe this thing
that you say we're all grandfathered in
i'll use the search engine (we've got much to discuss)
too much to discuss
over a bucket of balls
i can recall the glow of your low beams
it's the big night in tinsel city
life became a spectator sport
i launch my fragrance called "integrity"
i sell the fact that i can't be bought
have i told you all about the time
that i got sucked into a hole through a hand held device?
i will flashback now and again but i'm usually alright
thankfully the process has been simplified
since the last time you tried

i've recognized the glow of your low beams numerous times
i'll be by the batphone if you need to get a hold
making a selection
opening credits roll
panoramic windows looking out across your soul

you go in through the door
vengeance trilogy wallpaper walls
they have re-decorated it all
they've changed all the lights and the bar's down the side

i've recognized the glow of your low beams numerous times
through fairly opaque blinds in the sitting room
vehicles will pass by but i know when it's you
i'll be in a nose dive in my flying shoes
right behind your closed eyes like a memory from your youth
i'll be by the batphone if you need to get a hold
making a selection
opening credits roll
killer pink flamingos
computer controlled
panoramic windows looking out across your soul
still got pictures of friends on the wall
i suppose we aren't really friends anymore
maybe i shouldn't ever have called
that thing friendly at all
get freaked out from a knock at the door
when i haven't been expecting one
didn't that used to be part of the fun, once upon a time?
we'll be there at the back of the bar
in a booth like we usually were
every time there was a rocket launch
or some big event

what a death i died writing that song
start to finish, with you looking on
it stays between us, steinway and his sons
'cause it's the ultracheese
perhaps it's time that you went for a walk
and dress like a fictional character
from a place they called america
in the golden age
trust the politics to come along
when you were just trying to orbit the sun
when you were just about to be kind to someone
because you had the chance

i've still got pictures of friends on the wall
i might look as if i'm deep in thought
but the truth is i'm probably not
if i ever was

oh, the dawn won't stop weighing a tonne
i've done some things that i shouldn't have done
but i haven't stopped loving you once
i just wanted to be one of the strokes
now look at the mess you made me make
hitchhiking with a monogrammed suitcase
miles away from any half-useful imaginary highway

they've got a film up on the wall and it's dark enough to dance
what do you mean you've never seen blade runner?

oh, maybe i was a little too wild in the 70s
back down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer
elevator down to my make believe residency
from the honeymoon suite
two shows a day, four nights a week
easy money

so who you gonna call?
the martini police
so who you gonna call?
the martini police
baby, that isn't how they look tonight
it took the light absolutely forever to get to your eyes

and as we gaze skyward, ain't it dark early?
it's the star treatment, yeah
and as we gaze skyward, ain't it dark early?
it's the star treatment
it's the star treatment
the star treatment
dancing in my underpants
i'm gonna run for government
i'm gonna form a covers band and all
and back there by the baby grand
did mr. winter wonderland say
"come here, kid, we really need to talk"?
bear with me, man, i lost my train of thought

i fantasize, i call it quits
i swim with the economists
and i get to the bottom of it for good
by the time reality hits
the chimes of freedom fell to bits
the shining city on the fritz
they come out of the cracks
thirsty for blood

just as the apocalypse finally gets prioritized
and you cried some of the hottest tears you ever cried
multiplied by five
i suppose the singer must die

singsong 'round the money tree
this stunning documentary
that no one else unfortunately saw
such beautiful photography
it's worth it for the opening scene
i've been driving 'round listening to the score
or maybe, i just imagined it all
i've played to quiet rooms like this before
bear with me, man, i lost my train of thought
so when you gaze at planet earth from outer space
does it wipe that stupid look off of your face?
i saw this aura over the battleground states
i lost the money, lost the keys
but i'm still handcuffed to the briefcase

and i never thought, not in a million years
that i'd meet so many lovers
can i please have my money back?
my virtual reality mask is stuck on "parliament brawl"
emergency battery pack just in time
for my weekly chat with god on video call

breaking news, they take the truth and make it and fluid
the trainer's explanation was accepted by the steward
a montage of the latest ancient ruins
soundtracked by a chorus of "you don't know what you're doing"

and i never thought, not in a million years
that i'd meet so many lovers

and all of my most muscular regrets explode
behind my eyes like american sports

and i never thought, not in a million years
that i'd meet so many lovers
jesus in the day spa
filling out the information form
mama got her hair done
just popping out to sing a protest song
i've been on a bender back to that prophetic esplanade
where i ponder all the questions
but just manage to miss the mark

good afternoon
tranquility base hotel and casino
mark speaking
please tell me how may i direct your call?

this magical thinking
feels as if it really might catch on
mama wants some answers
do you remember where it all went wrong?
technological advances
really bloody get me in the mood
pull me in close on a crisp eve, baby
kiss me underneath the moon's side boob

good afternoon
tranquility base hotel and casino
mark speaking
please tell me how may i direct your call?

do you celebrate your dark side
then wish you'd never left the house?
have you ever spent a generation
trying to figure that one out?

good afternoon
tranquility base hotel and casino
mark speaking
please tell me how may i direct your call?

religious iconography giving you the creeps?
i feel rougher than a disco lizard tongue along your cheek
the rise of the machines
i must admit you gave me something momentarily
in which i could believe
but the hand of harsh reality's un-gloved
and it's on its way back in to scoop you up
but not on my watch

i won't stay with you, my love
the way some science fiction does

reflections in the silver screen of strange societies
swamp monster with a hard on for connectivity
the ascension of the cream
mass panic on a not too distant future colony
quantitative easing
i want to make a simple point about peace and love
but in a sexy way where it's not obvious

highlight dangers and send out hidden messages
the way some science fiction does
the way some science fiction does

i've got the world on a wire
in my little mirror mirror on the wall
in the pocket of my raincoat

so i tried to write a song to make you blush
but i've a feeling that the whole thing
may well just end up too clever for its own good
the way some science fiction does
one, two, three, four

she looks like fun
she looks like fun
she looks like fun
she looks like

smile like you've got a straw in something tropical
i've got the party plugged right into my skull
wayne manor, what a memorable n.y.e

(she looks like fun)
good morning
(she looks like fun)
cheeseburger
(she looks like fun)
snowboarding
(she looks like)

finally, i can share with you through cloudy skies
every whimsical thought that enters my mind
there's no limit to the length of the dickheads we can be

(she looks like fun)
bukowski
(she looks like fun)
dogsitting
(she looks like fun)
screwballing
(she looks like)

finally, there's a place where you can wag your tongue
baby, but why can't we all just get along?
dance as if somebody's watching, 'cause they are

no one's on the streets
we moved it all online
as of march
i'm so full of shite
i need to spend less time stood around in bars
waffling on to strangers all about martial arts
and how much i respect them

(she looks like fun)
key changes
(she looks like fun)
re-thinking
(she looks like fun)
new order
(she looks like fun)
i want an interesting synonym
to describe this thing
that you say we're all grandfathered in
i'll use the search engine (we've got much to discuss)
too much to discuss
over a bucket of balls
i can recall the glow of your low beams
it's the big night in tinsel city
life became a spectator sport
i launch my fragrance called "integrity"
i sell the fact that i can't be bought
have i told you all about the time
that i got sucked into a hole through a hand held device?
i will flashback now and again but i'm usually alright
thankfully the process has been simplified
since the last time you tried

i've recognized the glow of your low beams numerous times
i'll be by the batphone if you need to get a hold
making a selection
opening credits roll
panoramic windows looking out across your soul

you go in through the door
vengeance trilogy wallpaper walls
they have re-decorated it all
they've changed all the lights and the bar's down the side

i've recognized the glow of your low beams numerous times
through fairly opaque blinds in the sitting room
vehicles will pass by but i know when it's you
i'll be in a nose dive in my flying shoes
right behind your closed eyes like a memory from your youth
i'll be by the batphone if you need to get a hold
making a selection
opening credits roll
killer pink flamingos
computer controlled
panoramic windows looking out across your soul
still got pictures of friends on the wall
i suppose we aren't really friends anymore
maybe i shouldn't ever have called
that thing friendly at all
get freaked out from a knock at the door
when i haven't been expecting one
didn't that used to be part of the fun, once upon a time?
we'll be there at the back of the bar
in a booth like we usually were
every time there was a rocket launch
or some big event

what a death i died writing that song
start to finish, with you looking on
it stays between us, steinway and his sons
'cause it's the ultracheese
perhaps it's time that you went for a walk
and dress like a fictional character
from a place they called america
in the golden age
trust the politics to come along
when you were just trying to orbit the sun
when you were just about to be kind to someone
because you had the chance

i've still got pictures of friends on the wall
i might look as if i'm deep in thought
but the truth is i'm probably not
if i ever was

oh, the dawn won't stop weighing a tonne
i've done some things that i shouldn't have done
but i haven't stopped loving you once
have you got color in your cheeks'
do you ever get the feeling that you can't shift the tide
that sticks around like something's in your teeth
and some aces up your sleeve
i had no idea that you're in deep
i dreamt about you near me every night this week
how many secrets can you keep'
'cause there's this tune i found that makes me think of you somehow
when i play it on repeat
until i fall asleep
spilling drinks on my settee

(do i wanna know?)
if this feeling flows both ways
(sad to see you go)
was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(baby we both know)
that the nights were mainly made for saying
things that you can't say tomorrow day

crawlin' back to you.

ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'cause i always do
maybe i'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
now i've thought it through

crawling back to you

so have you got the guts?
been wondering if your heart's still open and
if so i wanna know what time it shuts
simmer down and pucker up
i'm sorry to interrupt it's just i'm constantly
on the cusp of trying to kiss you
i don't know if you feel the same as i do
but we could be together, if you wanted to

i'm a puppet on a string
tracy island, time-traveling diamond
could a shaped heartaches
come to find ya fall in some velvet morning

years too late
she's a silver lining lone ranger riding
through an open space
in my mind when she's not right there beside me

i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself
all i wanna hear her say is are you mine?

are you mine?
are you mine?
are you mine?

i guess what i'm trying to say is i need the deep end
keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
great escape lost track of time and space
she's a silver lining climbing on my desire

and i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself
all i wanna hear her say is are you mine?

are you mine?
are you mine?
are you mine?

and the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
so in case i'm mistaken
i just wanna hear you say you got me baby
are you mine?

she's a silver lining lone ranger riding through an open space
in my mind when she's not right there beside me
and i go crazy cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory

and i can't help myself
all i wanna hear her say is are you mine?
well are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
are you mine? (or just mine tonight?)
are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
(or just mine tonight?)
one for the road, ooh ooh
one for the road, ooh ooh

from the bottom of your heart
the relegation zone
i saw this coming from the start
the shake, rattle and roll
the cracks in blackout blinds
cast patterns on the ceiling but you're feeling fine
i thought it was dark outside
i thought it was dark outside

so we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me round baby, i feel like i've been in here before
i've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
will you pour me one for the road?

i knew this would be on the cards
i knew you wouldn't fold
i saw this coming from the start
the shake, rattle and roll

one for the road, ooh ooh

so we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me round baby, i feel like i've been in here before
i've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
will you pour me one for the road?

the mixture hits you hard
don't get that sinking feeling, don't fall apart
some out of tune guitar
soundtrack to disaster

ooh ooh, one for the road
ooh ooh, one for the road
ooh ooh, one for the road
ooh ooh, one for the road

so we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me round baby, i feel like i've been in here before
i've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
will you pour me one for the road?
arabella's got some interstellar-gator skin boots
and a helter skelter 'round her little finger and i ride it endlessly
she's got a barbarella silver swimsuit
and when she needs to shelter from reality she takes a dip in my daydreams

my days end best when this sunset gets itself
behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side
it's much less picturesque without her catching the light
the horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

as arabella
as arabella
just might have tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure

arabella's got a seventies head
but she's a modern lover
it's an exploration, she's made of outer space
and her lips are like the galaxy's edge
and her kiss the colour of a constellation falling into place

my days end best when this sunset gets itself
behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side
it's much less picturesque without her catching the light

just might have tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure

that's magic in a cheetah print coat
just a slip underneath it i hope
asking if i can have one of those
organic cigarettes that she smokes
wraps her lips round the mexican coke
makes you wish that you were the bottle
takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like…

just might have tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure
blind faith
heartache
mind games
mistakes
my sweet fireball
my sweet rigmarole
i want it all
i want it all

old dogs
new tricks
can you feel it?
space age country girl
stone cold miracle
i want it all
i want it all

and then suddenly it hit me it's a year ago
since i drank miniature whiskey and we shared your coke
ain't it just like you to kiss me and then hit the road
leave me listening to the stones
2000 light years from home

shoo-wop, shoo-wop
shoo-wop, shoo-wop
shoo-wop, shoo-wop

shoo-wop, shoo-wop
shoo-wop, shoo-wop
shoo-wop, shoo-wop

shoo-wop, shoo-wop
shoo-wop, shoo-wop
shoo-wop, shoo-wop

i want it all
i want it all
i want it all
i want it all
so you're on the prowl wondering whether she left already or not
leather jacket collar popped like antenna, never knowing when to stop
sunglasses indoors par for the course, lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
cages and poles

call off the search for your soul or put it on hold again
she's having a sly indoor smoke,
she calls the folks who run this her oldest friends,
sipping her drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
as all the signals are sent
her eyes invite you to approach
and it seems as though those lumps in your throat
that you just swallowed have got you going
come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on
number one party anthem

she's a certified mind blower knowing full well that i don't
i may suggest there's somewhere from which i might know her
just to get the ball to roll
drunken monologues, confused because
it's not like i'm falling in love i just want you to do me no good
and you look like you could

come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on
number one party anthem
come on, come on, come on
before the moment's gone
number one party anthem

the look of love
the rush of blood
the "she's with me"
the gallic shrug
the shutterbugs
the camera plus
the black and white and the colour dodge
the good time girls
the cubicles
the house of fun
the number one party anthem

mad sounds in your ears, they make you feel alright
they bring you back to life
mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
they make you get up
yeah they make you get up

love buckles under the strain of those wild nights
run but you cannot hide
mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
they make you get up
all night long they reappear
they make you get up and dance
yeah they make you get up

suppose you've gotta do what you gotta do
we just weren't feeling how we wanted to
you sit and try sometimes but you just can't figure out what went wrong
then out of nowhere somebody comes and hits you with an
ooh la la la, ooh la la la
ooh la la la ooh
ooh la la la, ooh la la la
ooh la la la ooh

you got those mad sounds in your ears to make you get up and dance
mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
they make you get up
i can't explain but i want to try
there's this image of you and i
and it goes dancing by in the morning and in the night time

there's all these secrets that i can't keep
like in my heart there's that hotel suite and you lived there so long,
it's kinda strange now you're gone

i'm not sure if i should show you what i've found
has it gone for good?
or is it coming back around?
isn't it hard to make up your mind?
when you're losing and your fuse is fireside

there's all those places we used to go
and i suspect you already know
but that place on memory lane you liked still looks the same
but something about it's changed

i'm not sure if i should show you what i've found
has it gone for good?
or is it coming back around?
isn't it hard to make up your mind?
when you're losing and your fuse is fireside

and i thought i was yours forever
maybe i was mistaken but i just cannot manage to make it through the day
without thinking of you lately

i'm not sure if i should show you what i've found
has it gone for good?
or is it coming back around?
isn't it hard to make up your mind?
when you're losing and your fuse is fireside

what's been happening in your world?
what have you been up to?
i heard that you fell in love
or near enough
i gotta tell you the truth…

i wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
i get the feeling i left it too late, but baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
if that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
i'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
snap out of it

forever isn't for everyone
is forever for you?
it sounds like settling down or giving up
but it don't sound much like you girl

i wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
i get the feeling i left it too late, but baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
if that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
i'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
snap out of it

under a spell you're hypnotized
darling how could you be so blind?
(snap out of it)

you got the lights on in the afternoon
and the nights are drawn out long
and you're kissing to cut through the gloom
with a cough drop coloured tongue
and you were sitting in the corner with the coats all piled high
and i thought you might be mine
in a small world on an exceptionally rainy tuesday night
in the right place and time

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks

well you cured my january blues
yeah you made it all alright
i got a feeling i might have lit the very fuse
that you were trying not to light
you were a stranger in my phonebook i was acting like i knew
'cause i had nothing to lose
when the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't coming true
ain't it funny what you'll do

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks

the late afternoon
the ghost in your room that you always thought didn't approve of you knocking boots
never stopped you letting me get hold of the sweet spot by the scruff of your
knee socks

you and me could have been a team
each had a half of a king and queen seat
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby

i wanna be your vacuum cleaner
breathing in your dust
i wanna be your ford cortina
i will never rust
if you like your coffee hot
let me be your coffee pot
you call the shots babe
i just wanna be yours

secrets i have held in my heart
are harder to hide than i thought
maybe i just wanna be yours
i wanna be yours, i wanna be yours
wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours

let me be your 'leccy meter and i'll never run out
and let me be the portable heater that you'll get cold without
i wanna be your setting lotion (i wanna be)
hold your hair in deep devotion (how deep?)
at least as deep as the pacific ocean
i wanna be yours

secrets i have held in my heart
are harder to hide than i thought

i'm a puppet on a string
tracy island, time-traveling diamond
could a shaped heartaches
come to find ya fall in some velvet morning

years too late
she's a silver lining lone ranger riding
through an open space
in my mind when she's not right there beside me

i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself
all i wanna hear her say is are you mine?

are you mine?
are you mine?
are you mine?

i guess what i'm trying to say is i need the deep end
keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
great escape lost track of time and space
she's a silver lining climbing on my desire

and i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself
all i wanna hear her say is are you mine?

are you mine?
are you mine?
are you mine?

and the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
so in case i'm mistaken
i just wanna hear you say you got me baby
are you mine?

she's a silver lining lone ranger riding through an open space
in my mind when she's not right there beside me
and i go crazy cause here isn't where i wanna be

and i can't help myself

well are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
are you mine? (or just mine tonight?)
are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)

one for the road, ooh ooh
one for the road, ooh ooh

from the bottom of your heart
the relegation zone
i saw this coming from the start
the shake, rattle and roll
the cracks in blackout blinds
cast patterns on the ceiling but you're feeling fine
i thought it was dark outside
i thought it was dark outside

so we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me round baby, i feel like i've been in here before
i've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
will you pour me one for the road?

i knew this would be on the cards
i knew you wouldn't fold
i saw this coming from the start
the shake, rattle and roll

one for the road, ooh ooh

so we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me round baby, i feel like i've been in here before
i've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
will you pour me one for the road?

the mixture hits you hard
don't get that sinking feeling, don't fall apart
some out of tune guitar
soundtrack to disaster

ooh ooh, one for the road
ooh ooh, one for the road
ooh ooh, one for the road
ooh ooh, one for the road

so we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me round baby, i feel like i've been in here before
i've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
will you pour me one for the road?
arabella's got some interstellar-gator skin boots
and a helter skelter 'round her little finger and i ride it endlessly
she's got a barbarella silver swimsuit
and when she needs to shelter from reality she takes a dip in my daydreams

my days end best when this sunset gets itself
behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side
it's much less picturesque without her catching the light
the horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

as arabella
as arabella
just might have tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure

arabella's got a seventies head
but she's a modern lover
it's an exploration, she's made of outer space
and her lips are like the galaxy's edge
and her kiss the colour of a constellation falling into place

that's magic in a cheetah print coat
just a slip underneath it i hope
asking if i can have one of those
organic cigarettes that she smokes
wraps her lips round the mexican coke
makes you wish that you were the bottle
takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like…

just might have tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure
blind faith
heartache
mind games
mistakes
my sweet fireball
my sweet rigmarole
i want it all
i want it all

old dogs
new tricks
can you feel it?
space age country girl
stone cold miracle
i want it all
i want it all

and then suddenly it hit me it's a year ago
since i drank miniature whiskey and we shared your coke
ain't it just like you to kiss me and then hit the road
leave me listening to the stones
2000 light years from home

shoo-wop, shoo-wop

leather jacket collar popped like antenna, never knowing when to stop
sunglasses indoors par for the course, lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
cages and poles

call off the search for your soul or put it on hold again
she's having a sly indoor smoke,
she calls the folks who run this her oldest friends,
sipping her drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
as all the signals are sent
her eyes invite you to approach
and it seems as though those lumps in your throat
that you just swallowed have got you going
come on, come on, come on

she's a certified mind blower knowing full well that i don't

the mirror's image
it tells me it's home time
but i'm not finished
'cause you're not by my side

and as i arrived i thought i saw you leaving
carrying your shoes
decided that once again i was just dreaming
of bumping into you

now it's three in the morning
and i'm trying to change your mind
left you multiple missed calls
and to my message you reply
why'd you only call me when you're high?
high
why'd you only call me when you're high?

somewhere darker
talking the same shite
i need a partner
well are you out tonight?

it's harder and harder to get you to listen
more i get through the gears
incapable of making alright decisions
and having bad ideas

now it's three in the morning
and i'm trying to change your mind
left you multiple missed calls

high
why'd you only call me when you're high?

and i can't see you here when i'm high
sort of feels like i'm running out of time
i haven't found all i was hoping to find
you said you got to be up in the morning
gonna have an early night
and you starting to bore me, baby
why'd you only call me when you're high?

why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?

do you ever get the feeling that you can't shift the tide
that sticks around like something's in your teeth
and some aces up your sleeve
i had no idea that you're in deep
i dreamt about you near me every night this week
how many secrets can you keep'
'cause there's this tune i found that makes me think of you somehow
when i play it on repeat
until i fall asleep
spilling drinks on my settee

(do i wanna know?)
if this feeling flows both ways
(sad to see you go)
was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(baby we both know)
that the nights were mainly made for saying
things that you can't say tomorrow day

crawlin' back to you.

ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'cause i always do
maybe i'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
now i've thought it through

crawling back to you

so have you got the guts?
been wondering if your heart's still open and
if so i wanna know what time it shuts
simmer down and pucker up
i'm sorry to interrupt it's just i'm constantly
on the cusp of trying to kiss you
i don't know if you feel the same as i do
but we could be together, if you wanted to

the cracks in blackout blinds
cast patterns on the ceiling but you're feeling fine
i thought it was dark outside
i thought it was dark outside

so we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me round baby, i feel like i've been in here before
i've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
will you pour me one for the road?

i knew this would be on the cards
i knew you wouldn't fold
i saw this coming from the start
the shake, rattle and roll

one for the road, ooh ooh

so we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me round baby, i feel like i've been in here before
i've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
will you pour me one for the road?

the mixture hits you hard
don't get that sinking feeling, don't fall apart
some out of tune guitar
soundtrack to disaster

ooh ooh, one for the road
ooh ooh, one for the road
ooh ooh, one for the road
ooh ooh, one for the road

so we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me round baby, i feel like i've been in here before

arabella's got some interstellar-gator skin boots
and a helter skelter 'round her little finger and i ride it endlessly
she's got a barbarella silver swimsuit
and when she needs to shelter from reality she takes a dip in my daydreams

my days end best when this sunset gets itself
behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side
it's much less picturesque without her catching the light
the horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

as arabella
as arabella
just might have tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure

arabella's got a seventies head
but she's a modern lover
it's an exploration, she's made of outer space
and her lips are like the galaxy's edge
and her kiss the colour of a constellation falling into place

my days end best when this sunset gets itself
behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side
it's much less picturesque without her catching the light
the horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

as arabella
as arabella
just might have tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure

that's magic in a cheetah print coat
just a slip underneath it i hope
asking if i can have one of those
organic cigarettes that she smokes
wraps her lips round the mexican coke
makes you wish that you were the bottle
takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like…

just might have tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure
blind faith
heartache
mind games
mistakes
my sweet fireball
my sweet rigmarole
i want it all
i want it all

old dogs
new tricks
can you feel it?
space age country girl
stone cold miracle
i want it all
i want it all

and then suddenly it hit me it's a year ago
since i drank miniature whiskey and we shared your coke
ain't it just like you to kiss me and then hit the road
leave me listening to the stones
2000 light years from home

shoo-wop, shoo-wop
shoo-wop, shoo-wop
shoo-wop, shoo-wop

shoo-wop, shoo-wop
shoo-wop, shoo-wop
shoo-wop, shoo-wop

shoo-wop, shoo-wop
shoo-wop, shoo-wop
shoo-wop, shoo-wop

i want it all
i want it all
i want it all
i want it all
so you're on the prowl wondering whether she left already or not
leather jacket collar popped like antenna, never knowing when to stop
sunglasses indoors par for the course, lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
cages and poles

call off the search for your soul or put it on hold again
she's having a sly indoor smoke,
she calls the folks who run this her oldest friends,
sipping her drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
as all the signals are sent
her eyes invite you to approach
and it seems as though those lumps in your throat
that you just swallowed have got you going
come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on
number one party anthem

she's a certified mind blower knowing full well that i don't
i may suggest there's somewhere from which i might know her
just to get the ball to roll
drunken monologues, confused because
it's not like i'm falling in love i just want you to do me no good
and you look like you could

come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on
number one party anthem
come on, come on, come on
before the moment's gone
number one party anthem

the look of love
the rush of blood
the "she's with me"
the gallic shrug
the shutterbugs
the camera plus
the black and white and the colour dodge
the good time girls
the cubicles
the house of fun
the number one party anthem

come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on
before the moment's gone
number one party anthem
number one party anthem
number one party anthem
mad sounds in your ears, they make you feel alright
they bring you back to life
mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
they make you get up
yeah they make you get up

love buckles under the strain of those wild nights
run but you cannot hide
mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
they make you get up
all night long they reappear
they make you get up and dance
yeah they make you get up

suppose you've gotta do what you gotta do
we just weren't feeling how we wanted to
you sit and try sometimes but you just can't figure out what went wrong
then out of nowhere somebody comes and hits you with an
ooh la la la, ooh la la la
ooh la la la ooh
ooh la la la, ooh la la la
ooh la la la ooh

you got those mad sounds in your ears to make you get up and dance
mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
they make you get up
i can't explain but i want to try
there's this image of you and i
and it goes dancing by in the morning and in the night time

there's all these secrets that i can't keep
like in my heart there's that hotel suite and you lived there so long,
it's kinda strange now you're gone

i'm not sure if i should show you what i've found
has it gone for good?
or is it coming back around?
isn't it hard to make up your mind?
when you're losing and your fuse is fireside

there's all those places we used to go
and i suspect you already know
but that place on memory lane you liked still looks the same
but something about it's changed

i'm not sure if i should show you what i've found
has it gone for good?
or is it coming back around?
isn't it hard to make up your mind?
when you're losing and your fuse is fireside

and i thought i was yours forever
maybe i was mistaken but i just cannot manage to make it through the day
without thinking of you lately

i'm not sure if i should show you what i've found
has it gone for good?
or is it coming back around?
isn't it hard to make up your mind?
when you're losing and your fuse is fireside
the mirror's image
it tells me it's home time
but i'm not finished
'cause you're not by my side

and as i arrived i thought i saw you leaving
carrying your shoes
decided that once again i was just dreaming
of bumping into you

now it's three in the morning
and i'm trying to change your mind
left you multiple missed calls
and to my message you reply
why'd you only call me when you're high?
high
why'd you only call me when you're high?

somewhere darker
talking the same shite
i need a partner
well are you out tonight?

it's harder and harder to get you to listen
more i get through the gears
incapable of making alright decisions
and having bad ideas

now it's three in the morning
and i'm trying to change your mind
left you multiple missed calls
and to my message you reply
(message you reply)
why'd you only call me when you're high?
(why'd you only call me when you're)
high
why'd you only call me when you're high?

and i can't see you here when i'm high
sort of feels like i'm running out of time
i haven't found all i was hoping to find
you said you got to be up in the morning
gonna have an early night
and you starting to bore me, baby
why'd you only call me when you're high?

why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?

why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
what's been happening in your world?
what have you been up to?
i heard that you fell in love
or near enough
i gotta tell you the truth…

i wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
i get the feeling i left it too late, but baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
if that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
i'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
snap out of it

forever isn't for everyone
is forever for you?
it sounds like settling down or giving up
but it don't sound much like you girl

i wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
i get the feeling i left it too late, but baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
if that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
i'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
snap out of it

under a spell you're hypnotized
darling how could you be so blind?
(snap out of it)

you got the lights on in the afternoon
and the nights are drawn out long
and you're kissing to cut through the gloom
with a cough drop coloured tongue
and you were sitting in the corner with the coats all piled high
and i thought you might be mine
in a small world on an exceptionally rainy tuesday night
in the right place and time

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks

well you cured my january blues
yeah you made it all alright
i got a feeling i might have lit the very fuse
that you were trying not to light
you were a stranger in my phonebook i was acting like i knew
'cause i had nothing to lose
when the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't coming true
ain't it funny what you'll do

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks

the late afternoon
the ghost in your room that you always thought didn't approve of you knocking boots
never stopped you letting me get hold of the sweet spot by the scruff of your
knee socks

you and me could have been a team
each had a half of a king and queen seat
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby

and it's coming after you

and neither one will cut her loose

all across the galaxy

with the exception of you i dislike everyone in the room
and i don't wanna lie, but i don't wanna tell you the truth

and you'll probably be leaving soon, so i'm telling you

stop the world 'cause i wanna, get off, with you
stop the world 'cause i wanna, get off, with you.

icing sugar dust. (crazy green flashes)
it's a funny thing, that i cannot explain

stop the world cause i wanna, get off, with you.

well i know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
and i don't wanna lie, and i don't wanna tell you the truth
and i know we got places to go, we got people to see

stop the world 'cause i wanna, get off, with you
stop the world 'cause i wanna, get off, with you.

from the bottom of your heart
the relegation zone

the shake, rattle and roll
the cracks in blackout blinds
cast patterns on the ceiling but you're feeling fine
i thought it was dark outside
i thought it was dark outside

so we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor

and your murder of crows

at the cemetary gates

cause you're so dark, babe

and even that was munster koach-esque
you watch italian horror and you listen to the scores
leather-clad and spike collar
i want you down on all fours

cause you're so dark, babe
but i want you hard
you're so dark, babe

i know you're nothing like mine
cause she's walking on sunshine
and your love would tear us apart
and i know i'm not your type
cause i don't shun the daylight
but baby i'm willing to start

you're so dark

got your h.p. lovecraft

lately i've been seeing things
belly button piercings in the sky at night
when we're side by side
and i don't mean to rain on anybody's cabaret
one of those games you're gonna lose
but you wanna play it just in case

and now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
more like black treacle than tar
black treacle
somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
and so they found a place to hide

does it help you stay up late?
does it help you concentrate?
is it true you win when you chew your chin?
am i ruining your fun?
and you talk the talk alright
do you walk the walk or catch the train?
you wanted it, you got it
but you don't want it now

now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
more like black treacle than tar
black treacle
somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
and so they found a place to hide

and now i'm out of place and i'm not getting any wiser
i feel like the sundance kid behind a synthesizer
and i tried last night to pack away a laugh
like a key under the mat
but it never seems to be there when you want it

black treacle
black treacle
black treacle
your love is like a studded leather headlock
your kiss, it put could creases in the rain
you're rarer than a can of dandelion and burdock

sit next to me before i go
jigsaw women with hollow movie blue shoes

how i often wonder where you are
you have got that face that just says
"baby, i was made to break your heart", oh-oh-oh

suck it and see, you never know
sit next to me before i go, go, go, go
jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
be cruel to me 'cause i am a fool for you
i'm a puppet on a string
tracy island, time-traveling diamond
could a shaped heartaches
come to find ya fall in some velvet morning

years too late
she's a silver lining lone ranger riding
through an open space
in my mind when she's not right there beside me

i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself
all i wanna hear her say is are you mine?

are you mine?
are you mine?
are you mine?

i guess what i'm trying to say is i need the deep end
keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
great escape lost track of time and space
she's a silver lining climbing on my desire

and i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself
all i wanna hear her say is are you mine?

are you mine?
are you mine?
are you mine?

and the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
so in case i'm mistaken
i just wanna hear you say you got me baby
are you mine?

she's a silver lining lone ranger riding through an open space
in my mind when she's not right there beside me
and i go crazy cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory

and i can't help myself
all i wanna hear her say is are you mine?
well are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
are you mine? (or just mine tonight?)
are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
(or just mine tonight?)
your love is like a studded leather headlock
your kiss, it put could creases in the rain
you're rarer than a can of dandelion and burdock
and those other girls are just postmix lemonade

suck it and see, you never know
sit next to me before i go
jigsaw women with hollow movie blue shoes
be cruel to me 'cause i'm a fool for you

i poured my aching heart into a pop song
i couldn't get the hang of poetry
that's not a skirt, girl, that's a sawn-off shotgun
and i can only hope you've got it aimed at me

suck it and see, you never know
sit next to me before i go
jigsaw women with hollow movie shoes
be cruel to me 'cause i'm a fool for

blue moon girls from once upon a shangri-la

she's thunderstorms
lying on her front
up against the wall
she's thunderstorms

i've been feeling foolish
you should try it
she came and substituted
the peace and quiet
for acrobatic blood 
flow constanting her?
her cheating heartbeat
rapid fire

she's thunderstorms
lying on her front
up against the wall
she's thunderstorms

hear who's your host
sounds as if she's pretty close
when the heat starts growing horns
she's thunderstorms

she's been loop-the-looping
around my mind
her motorcycle boots
give me this kind of
acrobatic blood?
constanting her?
cheating heartbeat
rapid fire

she's thunderstorms
lying on her front
up against the wall
she's thunderstorms
in an unusual place
when you're feeling far away
she does what the night does to the day

she's thunderstorms
lying on her front
up against the wall
she's thunderstorms
thunderstorms
thunderstorms
lately i've been seeing things
belly button piercings in the sky at night
when we're side by side
and i don't mean to rain on anybody's cabaret
one of those games you're gonna lose
but you wanna play it just in case

and now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
more like black treacle than tar
black treacle
somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
and so they found a place to hide

does it help you stay up late?
does it help you concentrate?
is it true you win when you chew your chin?
am i ruining your fun?
and you talk the talk alright
do you walk the walk or catch the train?
you wanted it, you got it
but you don't want it now

now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
more like black treacle than tar
black treacle
somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
and so they found a place to hide

and now i'm out of place and i'm not getting any wiser
i feel like the sundance kid behind a synthesizer
and i tried last night to pack away a laugh
like a key under the mat
but it never seems to be there when you want it

black treacle
black treacle
black treacle

i want to build you up (brick by brick)
i want to break you down (brick by brick)
i'm going to reconstruct (brick by brick)
i want to feel you love

brick by brick (ah)
brick by brick (ah)

i want to steal your soul (brick by brick)
i want to rock 'n' roll (brick by brick)
i want to rock and roll (brick by brick)
i want to rock and roll

brick by brick (ah)
brick by brick (ah)

i want a brick by brick (brick by brick)
i wanna blow wide berth (brick by brick)
i wanna melt this soul (brick by brick)
i wanna brick by brick, by brick, by

brick by brick (ah)
brick by brick (ah)
brick by brick (ah)
brick by brick (ah)
just when things are getting complicated in the eye of the storm
she flicks a red-hot revelation off the tip of her tongue
it does a dozen somersaults and it leaves you supercharged
makes me wanna blow her candles out just to see if you glow in the dark

shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
shalalala

home sweet home, home sweet home, home sweet booby-trap
i took the batteries out my mysticism and put 'em in my thinking cap

for when it gets too complicated in the eye of the storm

shalalala

oh, and in a hellcat spangled cavern
when your judgment's on the run
and you're acting like a stranger
'cause you thought it looked like fun

well did you ever get the feeling
did you think she set the fall
her steady hands may well have done the devil's pedicure
what you waiting for to sing another fuckin'

library pictures of the quickening canoe
the first of it's kind to get to the moon
draw some ellipses to chase you round the room
through curly straws and metaphors and goo

been watching all the neon blossom, flickering
you look as if you've all forgotten, where you've been
going riding through the thunder circle, fuzz canyon
ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one

library pictures of the quickening canoe
the first of it's kind to get to the moon
give me an eeny-meeny-miny-moe
or an ipp dipp, dog-shit rock and roll
caricatures of your wrecking ball 
in my mind all the time
i wanna be in that damsel-patterned alley
where you go for a smoke

and sorrow slow dances
the phones are lining up 
taking no chances
close but never close enough

been watching cowboy films
on gloomy afternoons
tinting the solitude
put on your dancing shoes
and show me what to do
i know you've got the moves

all my own stunts
hiding has changed its tune 
linking arms, syncing hearts

and sorrow slow dances
around the edges of her eyes
taking no chances
the last one out to win a prize

been watching cowboy films
on gloomy afternoons
tinting the solitude
put on your dancing shoes
and show me what to do
i know you've got the moves
topless models
doing semaphore
wave their flags as she walks by
and get ignored

illuminations
on a rainy day
when she walks her footsteps sing
a reckless serenade

i've been trying to figure out exactly what it is i need
call up to listen to the voice of reason
and got the answering machine

the type of kisses
where teeth collide
when she laughs the heavens hum a stun gun lullaby

those twinkling vixens
with a shining spiral eyes
their hypnosis goes unnoticed when she's walking by

i've been trying to figure out exactly what it is i need
call up to listen to the voice of reason
and got his answering machine

i left my message but did he forget back to me
and now i'm stuck here wondering
how it's meant to be

singing a reckless serenade
reckless serenade
reckless serenade
reckless serenade

reckless serenade
reckless serenade
reckless serenade
i etched a face of a stopwatch
on the back of a raindrop
and did a swap for the sand in an hourglass

i heard an unhappy ending
it sort of sounds like you leaving
i heard the piledriver waltz
it woke me up this morning

you look like you've been for breakfast
at the heartbreak hotel
and sat in the back booth
by the pamphlets and the literature
on how to lose
your waitress was miserable
and so was your food
if you're gonna try and walk on water
make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

mystery's flashing amber
go green when you answer
but the red on the rest of the questionnaire
never changes

i heard the news that you're planning
to shoot me out of a cannon
i heard the piledriver waltz
it woke me up this morning

you look like you've been for breakfast
at the heartbreak hotel
and sat in the back booth
by the pamphlets and the literature
on how to lose
your waitress was miserable
and so was your food
if you're gonna try and walk on water
make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

oh, piledriver
do you still feel younger than you thought you would by now
or, darling, have you started feeling old yet
don't worry, i'm sure that you're still breaking hearts
with the efficiency that only youth can harness
and do you still think love is a laserquest
or do you take it all more seriously
i've tried to ask you this in some daydreams that i've had
but you're always busy being make-believe
and do you look into the mirror to remind yourself you're there
or have somebody's good-night kisses got that covered
well i'm not being honest, i'll pretend that you were just some lover

now i can't think of air without thinking of you
i doubt that comes as a surprise
and i can't think of anything to dream about
i can't find anywhere to hide
and when i'm hanging on by the rings around my eyes
and i convince myself i need another
and for a minute it gets easier to pretend that you were just some lover

when i'm pipe and slippers and rocking chair
singing dreadful songs about something
well i've found a better method of pretending you were just some lover
well i've found a better method of pretending you were just some lover
a pussyfooting setting sun
make a wish that weighs a ton
there are no handles for you to hold
and no understanding where it goes

jealously in technicolor
fear by name, love by numbers
street lamp amber, wanderlust
hide her in a blunderbus

she looks as if she's blowing at kiss at me
and suddenly the sky is a scissor
sitting on the floor with a tambourine
crushing up a bundle of love
don't take it so personally
you're not the only one
that time has got it in for honey
that's where you're wrong

all the old flames fastened on
make a wish that weighs a ton
there are no handles that you can hold
and no understanding where it goes

she looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me
and suddenly the sky is a scissor
sitting on the floor with a tambourine
crushing up a bundle of love
don't take it so personally
you're not the only one,
that time has got it in for honey

that's where you're wrong
that's where you're wrong
that's where you're wrong

searching for a language that the 2 of us can speak

if you can summon the strength, tow me
i can't hold down the urgency
you've got to make your descent slowly
and oil up those sticky keys

coax me out my low
and have a spin of my propeller

it's a necessary evil
no cause for emergency
borrowed the beak of a bald eagle

been trying to think of something colorful for this season
pull the wool over the gullible for no reason
you are all i have these days, shake it up and run away
with the night squabbling behind you

from the smoke in your hair to the blood in the bruise
and the bows on the shoes you kicked off
i'm joining the dots
i'm joining the dots

i thought i heard them talking in their sleep yesterday
and i tried but i just can't believe a word they say
hurry up they'll be here soon, sleeping in the afternoon
while the rain's trying to prove a point outside

from the smoke in your hair to the blood in the bruise
and the bows on the shoes you kicked off
i'm joining the dots, i'm joining the dots
i'm joining the dots

those people make me calm, calm the flame
come up to the moth for a change
darling if it's all the same to you, i'll have you to myself
i'm joining the dots, i'm joining the dots
made me kiss ya' with a whisper
and violently you swung, through unfamiliar tongue
couldn't listen to tradition, grabbed me by the wrist to silently insist

and when i'm in the confines of crawling walls, you hold me in place
the ripples on the ceiling the avenues, unsugared taste
waste away the evening, the afternoon, the afternoon's hat
together we'll find something to direct some laughter at

you stood shirtless and confident
listenin' to the fools, tickling the rules
their obsessions follow patterns
sat upon their stools, with their attitudes

and when i'm in the confines of crawling walls, you hold me in place
the ripples on the ceiling the avenues, unsugared taste
waste away the evening, the afternoon, the afternoon's hat
together we'll find something to direct some laughter at

in the painted faces congregate
in the mating season
the seconds homes
they go alone
in no rush leave 'em
and there's a fountain
and a scimitar
shaped yellow light
and it picks you up
and cuts you down to size

the people there
and the furniture
start to seem important
a moment more
and you catch the floor
with a vivid and absorbent sharpened arc
like the scimitar
shaped yellow light
that picks you up
and cuts you down to size

oh i had questions for the tap dancer
sat on my lap
and she had child proof caps on her answers
stone blower blow me a stone
and show me that handsome enchancer
she had a rock on her throttle
and a brown glass bottle full of
shavings from the sun
although those shoes affect your step
don't forget whose legs you're on

there's a fountain and a scimitar
shaped yellow light
and it picks you up
and it cuts you down to size
so who's that girl there? 
i wonder what went wrong
so that she had to roam the streets
she don't do major credit cards
i doubt she does receipts
it's all not quite legitimate
and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes, yeah
that he's got a driving ban
amongst some other offences

and i've seen him with girls of the night
he told roxanne to put on her red light
they're all infected but he'll be alright
'cause he's a scumbag, don't you know
i said he's a scumbag, don't you know! 

although you're trying not to listen
i bet your eyes are staring at the ground
she makes a subtle proposition
i'm sorry love i'll have to turn you down

and oh he must be up to something
want half a chance to show he's more than likely
i've got a feeling in my stomach
i start to wonder what his story might be
what his story might be

they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here
around, here

and look here comes a ford mondeo
isn't he mister inconspicuous
and he don't have to say 'owt
she's in the stance ready to get picked up

and she's delighted when she sees him
pulling in and giving her the eye
because she must be fucking freezing
scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
and don't stop in the winter no and

they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here

they said it changes when the sun goes down
over the river going out of town
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here
around here

and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes that he's got a nasty plan
i hope you're not involved at all

so up rolls a riot van
and sparks excitement in the boys
but the policemen look annoyed
perhaps these are ones they should avoid

got chased last night
from men with truncheons dressed in hats
we didn't do that much wrong
still ran away though for the laugh
just for the laugh
and please just stop talking cause they won't find us if you do
oh those silly boys in blue
well they won't catch me and you

have you been drinking son, you don't look old enough to me
i'm sorry officer, is there a certain age you're supposed to be, cause nobody told me

and up rolls the riot van
and these lads just wind the coppers up
they ask why they don't catch proper crooks
they get their address and their names took
but they couldn't care less

thrown in a riot van
and all the coppers kicked him in
and there was no way he could win
just had to take it on the chin

what on earth's the plan, has he got one?
you better give me some pointers
since you are the big rocket launcher
and i'm just the shotgun
well, i ain't got no dollar signs in my eyes
that might be a surprise but it's true
said, i'm not like you
and i don't want your advice or your praise
or to move in the ways you do
and i never will

'cause all you people are vampires
and all your stories are stale
and though you pretend to stand by us
i know you're certain we'll fail

well, i've seen your eyes as they fix on me
full of confusion
your snarl is just so condescending
try to explain that we're on to a win
if the fee we got in
near recoups what we're spending
he said, "i can't believe that you drove all that way
well, how much did they pay ya? how much did they pay ya?
you'd have been better to stay round our way"
thinking 'bout things but not actually doing the things

'cause all you people are vampires
and all your stories are stale
and though you pretend to stand by us
i know you're certain we'll fail

'cause all you people are vampires
and all your stories are stale
and though you pretend to stand by us
i know you're certain we'll fail

all you people are vampires
get on your dancing shoes
there's one thing on your mind
hoping they're looking for you
sure you'll be rummaging through

oh and the shit, shock, the horror
you've seen your future bride
yeah, but it's oh so absurd
for you to say the first word
so you're waiting and waiting and

the only reason that you came
so what you scared for
oh, don't you always do the same
it's what you there for, don't you know

the lights are flashing
down in here tonight
and some might exchange a glance
but keep pretending to dance

don't act like it's not happening
as if it's impolite
to go and mention your name
instead you'll just do the same
as they all do, and hope for the best

the only reason that you came
so what you scared for
well don't you always do the same
it's what you're there for but no

get on your dancing shoes
you sexy little swine
hoping they're looking for you
sure you'll be rummaging through

and i said the shit, shock, horror
you've seen your future bride, yeah
yeah, but it's oh so absurd
for you to say the first word
so you're waiting and waiting
stop making the eyes at me
i'll stop making the eyes at you
what it is that surprises me
is that i don't really want you to

and your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
your name isn't rio, but i don't care for sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
well, from 1984

i wish you'd stop ignoring me
because you're sending me to despair
without a sound, yeah, you're calling me
and i don't think it's very fair

that your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
your name isn't rio, but i don't care for sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
well, from 1984

oh, there ain't no love, no montagues or capulets
just banging tunes and dj sets and
dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness

well, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
said, from 1984
said, who's that girl there? 
i wonder what went wrong
so that she had to roam the streets
she don't do major credit cards
i doubt she does receipts
it's all not quite legitimate

and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes, yeah
that he's got a driving ban
amongst some other offences

and i've seen him with girls of the night
and he told roxanne to put on her red light
they're all infected but he'll be alright
'cause he's a scumbag, don't you know?
i said, he's a scumbag, don't you know?

although you're trying not to listen
avert your eyes and staring at the ground
she makes a subtle proposition
"i'm sorry, love, i'll have to turn you down"
and oh, he must be up to summat
what are the chances? sure it's more than likely
i've got a feeling in my stomach
and start to wonder what his story might be
what his story might be, yeah

'cause they said it changes when the sun goes down
yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here, around here, oh

and look here comes a ford mondeo
isn't he mister inconspicuous?
and he don't have to say 'owt
she's in the stance ready to get picked up
bet she's delighted when she sees him
pulling in and giving her the eye
because she must be fucking freezing
scantily-clad beneath the clear night sky
and don't stop in the winter, no

and they said it changes when the sun goes down
yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here

well, they said it changes when the sun goes down
over the river, going out of town
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here, around here, oh

and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes, yeah, that he's got a nasty plan
i hope you're not involved at all
well, oh, they might wear classic reeboks
or knackered converse
or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
but all of that's what the point is not
the point's that there ain't no romance around there

and there's the truth that they can't see
they'd probably like to throw a punch at me
and if you could only see 'em, then you would agree
agree that there ain't no romance around there

you know, oh, it's a funny thing you know
we'll tell 'em if you like
we'll tell 'em all tonight
they'll never listen
because their minds are made up
and course it's all okay to carry on that way

'cause over there, there's broken bones
there's only music, so that there's new ringtones
and it don't take no sherlock holmes
to see it's a little different around here

don't get me wrong, though, there's boys in bands
and kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
and just 'cause he's had a couple o' cans
he thinks it's all right to act like a dickhead

don't you know, oh' it's a funny thing you know
we'll tell 'em if you like
we'll tell 'em all tonight
they'll never listen
because their minds are made up
and course it's all okay to carry on that way

but i said no
oh no
well, you won't get me to go
not anywhere, not anywhere
no, i won't go
oh no no

well, over there, there's friends of mine
what can i say? i've known 'em for a long long time
and, yeah, they might overstep the line
but you just cannot get angry in the same way
no, not in the same way
said, not in the same way
oh no, oh no no

he sank into their calculations
and snorted on the stench
of their arithmetic.
looked for the boy who was hanging his head low,
more trophies than ideas. to follow their pretence.

with a scowl in his pocket and a smile on his face
he followed with obidience
and fell in the nettles.

afterwards those spikey whispers said he bought his own rope.
and skipped the bits they loathed.
didn't scramble to find a dock leaf to capture back our hope
to advice his mind had closed
he lost all of his footholes.

he was a toothpick!
and the garlic and the cinder upon the path
had failed to blunt or hinder the slow collapse
clinging to the doorframe he was dragged
off to a reminder of where he had been.

with a smile in his pocket
and a scowl on his face
he had nowhere to flee
so sat content in the nettles.




fools on parade cavort and carry on 
for waiting eyes 
that you would rather be beside than in front of 
but she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares 

she swam out of tonight's phantasm 
grabbed my hand and made it very clear 
there's absolutely nothing for us here 
it's a magnolia celebration 

to be attempted on a wednesday night 
it's better than to get a reputation 
as a miserable little tyke 
at least that's the conclusion 
she came to in this overture 

the secret door swings behind us 
she's saying nothing 
she's just giggling along 

her arms were folded most indignant 
not looking like she was soon to leave 
i had to squint in order to believe 
and then like a butler pushing on a bookshelf 

i'm unveiling the unexpected 
how she was never gonna look to? 
suddenly embarrassed and corrected 
how could such a creature 
survive in such a habitat

tricking through the morning,

weighs coil 'til the corner is turned.

fiendish wonder in the carnival's wake 
though it caresses once again irritate 
tread softly stranger 
move over toward the danger that you seek 

you think excitement has receded 
and the mirror distracts 
the logic of the trance 
quickly reaches and grasps 
handsome and faceless 
and weightless, your imagination roams 

and now it's no ones fault but yours 
at the foot of the house of cards 
you thought you'd never get obsessed 
you thought the wolves would be impressed 
and you're a sinking stone 
but you know what it's like to hold the jeweler's hand 
that procession of pioneers all drowned 

in the moonlight they're more thrilling 
those things that he knows 
as he leads you through the grinning 
bubble blowers in the snow 
watching his exit 
is like falling off the ferry in the night 

the inevitables gather to push you around 
any old voice makes a punishing sound 
he became laughter's assassin 
shortly after he showed you what it was 

and now it's no ones fault but yours 
at the foot of the house of cards 
you thought you'd never get obsessed 
you thought the wolves would be impressed 
and you're a sinking stone 
but you know what it's like to hold the jeweler's hand 
that procession of pioneers all drowned 

if you've a lesson to teach me, 
i'm listening, ready to learn 
there's no one here to police me, 
i'm sinking in, until you return 

if you've a lesson to teach me, 
don't deviate, don't be afraid 
without the last corner piece i can't calibrate,

when i got back from fixing my hair,
you were directing traffic.
letting your story slip on the snow as
if the transmission was automatic.
it's arguable
that i shouldn't have been there.
it was fortunate timing.
i had a hole in the pocket
of my favorite coat
and my love dropped
into the lining.
(have you got your strange?)
not on me. i haven't got my strange
(have you got your strange?)
not on me
you can't sleep
until you've sat
on the steps to weep
until you feel like
you've wept yeah.
(as long as you don't forget your strange)
(have you got your strange?)
no, not on me. i haven't got my strange
i've better fetch my strange.
i haven't got my strange.
if you can summon the strength, tow me
i can't hold down the urgency
you've got to make your descent slowly
and oil up those sticky keys

coax me out my low
and have a spin of my propeller

it's a necessary evil
no cause for emergency
borrowed the beak of a bald eagle
oh, momentary synergy

coax me out my low
sink into tomorrow
coax me out my low
and have a spin of my propeller

my propeller won't spin and i can't get it started on my own
when are you arriving?
my propeller won't spin and i can't get it started on my own
when are you arriving?
my propeller won't spin and i can't get it started on my own
when are you arriving?
my propeller

been fighting with my sheets
and nearly crying in my sleep
yes, i'm battling that well taught gripe
the most restraining type
you should have racing stripes

the way you keep me in pursuit
sharpen the heel of your boot
and you press it to my chest and you make me wheeze
then to my knees you do promote me

i'm pinned down by the dark
a-n-i-m-a-l
makes my head pirouette
more than i won't be willing to confess
d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s

the light it fidgets through
the thoughts'll soon revert to you
about as bashful as a tribal dance
the first and final chance
and cause the audience

the frighteners and fiends
divided up into two teams
when the acrobat fell off the beam
she broke everyone's hearts

i'm pinned down by the dark
a-n-i-m-a-l
makes my head pirouette
more than i would be willing to confess
d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s

d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s
the most unsuitable pet
it's been long enough now so let's
make a mess lioness

pinned down by the dark
i'm pinned down by the dark

d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s
a-n-i-m-a-l

you showed me my tomorrow 
beside a box of matches 
a welcome threatening stir 

my hopes of being stolen 
might just ring true 
depends who you prefer 

but if it's true you're gonna run away 
tell me where 
i'll meet you there 

am i snapping the excitement 
if i pack away the laugther 
and tell you how it feels 

and does burden come to meet ya 
if i've questions of the feature that runs on your dream wheel 

the day after you stole my heart, 
everything i touched told me it would be better shared with you 

with you 

and now you're hiding in my sleep
and the book reveals your face 
and there's a splashing in my eyelids 
as the concentration continually breaks 

i did request the mark you cast 
didn't heal as fast 
i hear your voice in silences 
will the teasing of the fire be followed by the thud? 

and the jostling crowd 
you're not allowed to tell the truth 
and the photo booth's a liar 

and the sharpened explanation
but there's no screaming reason to inquire 
i'd like to poke them in their prying eyes 
with things they never see if it smacked them in their temples
i thought i saw you in the battleship
but it was only a look a like
she was nothing but a vision trick
under the warning light
she was close, close enough to be your ghost
but my chances turned to toast
when i asked her if i could call her your name

i thought i saw you in the rusty hook
huddled up in wicker chair
i wandered up for a closer look
and kissed who ever was sitting there

she was close, and she held me very tightly
'til i asked awfully politely, please
can i call you her name

and i elongated my lift home,
yeah i let him go the long way round
i smelt your scent on the seat belt
and kept my shortcuts to myself

i thought i saw you in the parrots beak
messing with the smoke alarm
it was too loud for me to hear her speak
and she had a broken arm

it was close, so close that the walls were wet
and she wrote it out in letraset
no you can't call me her name

tell me where's your hiding place
i'm worried i'll forget your face
and i've asked everyone
i'm beginning to think i imagined you all along

i elongated my lift home
yeah i let him go the long way 'round
i smelt your scent on the seat belt
and kept my shortcuts to myself

i saw your sister in the cornerstone
on the phone to the middle man
when i saw that she was on her own
i thought she might understand

she was close, well you couldn't get much closer
she said i'm really not supposed to but yes,
you can call me anything you want
i heard the truth was built to bend 
a mechanism to suspend the guilt 
is what you are requiring still 
you've got to dance little liar 

just like those fibbs that pop and fizz 
and you'll be forced to take that awful quiz 
and you're bound to trip 
and she'll detect the fiction on 
your lips and dig a contradiction up 

and the clean coming will hurt 
and you can never get it spotless 
when there's dirt beneath the dirt 
the liar take a lot less time 

i'm sure it's clear and plain to me 
its not an alibi you need just yet 
oh no it's something for those beads of sweat 
yes that we'll get you back to normal 

and after you have dabbed the patch you'll grieve 
and then proceed to scratch the varnish off 
that newly added calmness 
so as not to raise any alarms too soon 

and the clean coming will hurt 
and you can never get it spotless 
when there's dirt beneath the dirt 

the liar takes a lot less 

time to decide on his saunter 
have you got itchy bones 
and in all your time alone 
can you hack your mind being riddled 
with the wrong memories 

and the clean coming will hurt 
and you can never get it spotless

and now it's no ones fault but yours 
at the foot of the house of cards 
you thought you'd never get obsessed 
you thought the wolves would be impressed 
and you're a sinking stone 
but you know what it's like to hold the jeweler's hand 
that procession of pioneers all drowned 

if you've a lesson to teach me, 
i'm listening, ready to learn

if you can summon the strength, tow me
i can't hold down the urgency
you've got to make your descent slowly
and oil up those sticky keys

coax me out my low
and have a spin of my propeller

it's a necessary evil
no cause for emergency
borrowed the beak of a bald eagle
oh, momentary synergy

coax me out my low

been fighting with my sheets
and nearly crying in my sleep
yes, i'm battling that well taught gripe
the most restraining type
you should have racing stripes

the way you keep me in pursuit
sharpen the heel of your boot
and you press it to my chest and you make me wheeze
then to my knees you do promote me

i'm pinned down by the dark
a-n-i-m-a-l
makes my head pirouette
more than i won't be willing to confess
d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s

the light it fidgets through
the thoughts'll soon revert to you
about as bashful as a tribal dance
the first and final chance
and cause the audience

the frighteners and fiends
divided up into two teams
when the acrobat fell off the beam
she broke everyone's hearts

i'm pinned down by the dark
a-n-i-m-a-l
makes my head pirouette
more than i would be willing to confess
d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s

d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s
the most unsuitable pet
it's been long enough now so let's
make a mess lioness

pinned down by the dark
i'm pinned down by the dark

you showed me my tomorrow 
beside a box of matches 
a welcome threatening stir 

my hopes of being stolen 
might just ring true 
depends who you prefer 

but if it's true you're gonna run away 
tell me where 
i'll meet you there 

am i snapping the excitement 
if i pack away the laugther 
and tell you how it feels 

and does burden come to meet ya 
if i've questions of the feature that runs on your dream wheel 

the day after you stole my heart, 
everything i touched told me it would be better shared with you 

with you 

and now you're hiding in my sleep
and the book reveals your face 
and there's a splashing in my eyelids 
as the concentration continually breaks 

i did request the mark you cast 
didn't heal as fast 
i hear your voice in silences 
will the teasing of the fire be followed by the thud? 

and the jostling crowd 
you're not allowed to tell the truth 
and the photo booth's a liar 

and the sharpened explanation
but there's no screaming reason to inquire 
i'd like to poke them in their prying eyes 
with things they never see if it smacked them in their temples

i heard the truth was built to bend 
a mechanism to suspend the guilt 
is what you are requiring still 
you've got to dance little liar 

just like those fibbs that pop and fizz 
and you'll be forced to take that awful quiz 
and you're bound to trip 
and she'll detect the fiction on 
your lips and dig a contradiction up 

and the clean coming will hurt 
and you can never get it spotless 
when there's dirt beneath the dirt 
the liar take a lot less time 

i'm sure it's clear and plain to me 
its not an alibi you need just yet 
oh no it's something for those beads of sweat 
yes that we'll get you back to normal 

and after you have dabbed the patch you'll grieve 
and then proceed to scratch the varnish off 
that newly added calmness 
so as not to raise any alarms too soon 

and the clean coming will hurt 
and you can never get it spotless 
when there's dirt beneath the dirt 

the liar takes a lot less 

time to decide on his saunter 
have you got itchy bones 
and in all your time alone 
can you hack your mind being riddled 
with the wrong memories 

and the clean coming will hurt 
and you can never get it spotless 
when there's dirt between the dirt
tricking through the morning, 
the tramp with the trampoline under his arm, 
shifts past your whiskers, 
so spark is a charm with the barking alarm, 
weighs coil 'til the corner is turned. 

and the bicycle wheels, all struggle to move round, 
in your muddy mind, 
blatantly cape town, 
and will intertwine in co-operative time, 
shall we sit on the springs 'til the mung goes dry? 

all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms 
and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall, 
all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms

what came first the chicken or the dickhead? 
split sleep reeps through rewards and ill fitting thoughts, 
a twilight force, she doesn't wanna walk, 
your legs start running and your head gets caught, 
cannot be nineteen, it's perfectly placed for the reasonably frightening, 
pulled from the after taste, you'll have to slip away, 
and i'm happy to say, 
behold as the crook in a hammock plays

all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms 
and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall, 
all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms 
and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall

behold as the crook in the hammock plays, 
crawling with the base of the scales, 
and fiddles with the feet on a balancing act, 
gagged, bound and craft in a tale, 
trailing wrapped in a gasp, 

crawling with the base of the scales, 
and fucking fiddles with the feet on a balancing act, 
you were gagged, bound and craft in a tale,

fiendish wonder in the carnival's wake 
though it caresses once again irritate 
tread softly stranger 
move over toward the danger that you seek 

you think excitement has receded 
and the mirror distracts 
the logic of the trance 
quickly reaches and grasps 
handsome and faceless 
and weightless, your imagination roams 

and now it's no ones fault but yours 
at the foot of the house of cards 
you thought you'd never get obsessed 
you thought the wolves would be impressed 
and you're a sinking stone 
but you know what it's like to hold the jeweler's hand 
that procession of pioneers all drowned 

in the moonlight they're more thrilling 
those things that he knows 
as he leads you through the grinning 
bubble blowers in the snow 
watching his exit 
is like falling off the ferry in the night 

the inevitables gather to push you around 
any old voice makes a punishing sound 
he became laughter's assassin 
shortly after he showed you what it was

when i got back from fixing my hair,
you were directing traffic.
letting your story slip on the snow as
if the transmission was automatic.
it's arguable
that i shouldn't have been there.
it was fortunate timing.
i had a hole in the pocket
of my favorite coat
and my love dropped
into the lining.
(have you got your strange?)
not on me. i haven't got my strange
(have you got your strange?)
not on me
you can't sleep
until you've sat
on the steps to weep
until you feel like
you've wept yeah.
(as long as you don't forget your strange)
(have you got your strange?)
no, not on me. i haven't got my strange
i've better fetch my strange.
i haven't got my strange.
oh baby, i'm wanting to do you a swap
i'll give you anything, yeah
in return for the noises you've got
and i can see you want to be attended to
just count to twenty-nine and i'll attend to you
oh for sure, well certainly, yeah yeah yeah

wavin' bye to the train or the bus
i'm ever so worried because
i don't want to get all forgotten

so very comfortable
don't really need to put up my feet
and even in fat sam's grand slam
can't see it being easier to speak
when you've karate-kicked your way to someone new
and i'm a memory and don't know what to do
all on his own
collecting his dole n' stuff

wavin' bye to the train or the bus
i'm ever so worried because
i don't want to get all forgotten
'cause we know
yeah, we know-oh-oh-oh
oh we know, a whoa-oh-oh

don't know where we're going, baby
i s'pose it depends
but even if we're all far apart
we can all come back and all be fine
we'll be able to be together again

be together again
be together again
be together again

everybody will be together again
stop making the eyes at me
i'll stop making the eyes at you
what it is that surprises me
is that i don't really want you to

and your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
your name isn't rio, but i don't care for sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
well, from 1984

i wish you'd stop ignoring me
because you're sending me to despair
without a sound, yeah, you're calling me
and i don't think it's very fair

that your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)

just banging tunes and dj sets and
dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness!

diamonds are forever,
they are all i need to please me,
they can stimulate and tease me,
they won't leave in the night,
i've no fear that they might desert me.
diamonds are forever,
hold one up and then caress it,
touch it, stroke it and undress it,
i can see every part,
nothing hides in the heart to hurt me.

i don't need love,
for what good will love do me?
diamonds never lie to me,
for when love's gone,
they'll luster on.

diamonds are forever,
sparkling round my little finger.
unlike men, the diamonds linger;
men are mere mortals who
are not worth going to your grave for.

i don't need love,
for what good will love do me?
diamonds never lie to me,
for when love's gone,
they'll luster on.

diamonds are forever, forever, forever.

forever and ever

anything we should know about your change? -- oh and the cost to correct a fraud
a fraud
i'm going to go out and kid them
applaud
applaud
if you're the highest bidder, i'm yours

you figure out pathetic sets
we're not sure of the etiquette
we think out pathetic sets
we're not sure of the etiquette

and if you found this it's probably too late
clinically cynical hereditary hate
if you found this it's probably too late
ever so clinical i'm running out of mates

if we concentrate on being off the cuff
not sure we're ready but probably rough

i don't ever want to hate you
so don't show me your bed
the only roads are cul-de-sacs
the first thing that she said

temptation, greets you like your naughty mate
the one that used to get you in bother
but one you could never bring yourself to hate

and she said we've got that spark
that only lights a fuse
helps you see in the dark
but it's a sight you'll lose when
the temptation greets you like your naughty friend

i don't ever want to hate you
so don't show me your bed
the only roads are cul-de-sacs
the only ends are dead

temptation greets you like your naughty mate
one that made you steal and set things on fire
but one you haven't seen of late

and i said that kind of talk
only adds intrigue
to the cauldron of thought
it's already exceeding
temptation, the very thing that held her back

i don't ever want to hate you
so don't show me your bed
the only roads are cul-de-sacs
the only ends are dead

i don't ever want to hate you
it's not part of the plan
so keep your charm where i can't see it

and your hands where i can

we used to be in tight me and my naughty friends
caused enticement in the air
i mean day 'n' night
we robbed, we stole, we loved to fight
smoking, drinking, joyriding
drugs, thugs, not law-abiding
reckless gangsters, no direction
no sign of correction
but then i switched it off
changed my ways
what the hell
like oh my days
but like my naughty friends
they're not phased
can't believe that this music pays
see no reason why we can't do
all the things we've always done
still in my heart i know that's just what
but its hard to fight the temptation son

the panic will fall down around you
if you don't do what i say

i don't ever want to hate you
so don't show me your bed
the only roads are cul-de-sacs
the only ends are dead

i don't ever want to hate you
it's not part of the plan
so keep your charm where i can't see it

despair to the point will they provoke
the punchline before they have told the joke
the sheer desperation to be seen
staring at the television screen

despair to the point where they provoke
you to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke

it wasn't in the top one hundred list

and it's the thousandth time, and it's even bolder
don't be surprised when you get bent over
he told ya that you were dying for it

she saw it, and she grabbed it, and it wasn't what it seemed
the kids all dream of making it, whatever that means
another variation on a theme
a tangle on the television and the magazine
do you reckon that they do it for a joke?
do you reckon that they make 'em take an oath
that says 'we are defenders
of any poseur or professional pretender around

when did your list replace the twist and turn
ah, the fist replaced the kissed-on concern
and if you're bothered, i don't want your prayers
save it for the morning after

and it's the thousandth time, and it's even bolder

running off over next doors garden
before the hour is done
it's more a question of feeling
than it is a question of fun
the confidence is the balaclava
i'm sure you'll baffle 'em good
with the ending wreak of salty cheeks
and runny makeup alone

oh, will blood run down the face
of a boy bewildered and scorned
and you'll find yourself in a skirmish
where you wish you'd never been born
you tie yourself to the tracks
and there isn't no going back
and it's wrong, wrong, wrong
but we'll do it anyway 'cause we love a bit of trouble

are you pulling her from a burning building
or throwing her to the sharks?
can only hope that the ending is a pleasurable as the start
the confidence is the balaclava
i'm sure you baffle 'em straight
and it's wrong, wrong, wrong
she can hardly wait

now the shaggers perform
and the daggers are drawn
who's the crooks in this crime?

that's right, he won't let her out his sight

you knew that he'd be trouble right before the very first kiss
quiet and unassuming, but you heard that they were the naughtiest
she pleaded with you to take it off
but you resisted and fought
sorry sweetheart abba drava
keep on the balaclava
you used to get it in your fishnets
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
landed in a very common crisis
everything's in order in a black hole
nothing seems as pretty as the past though
that bloody mary's lacking a tabasco
remember when he used to be a rascal?

oh, that boy's a slag
the best you ever had
the best you ever had
is just a memory and those dreams
not as daft as they seem
not as daft as they seem
my love, when you dream them up

flicking through a little book of sex tips
remember when the boys were all electric?
now, when she tells she's gonna get it
i'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
clinging to not getting sentimental
said, she wasn't going, but she went, still
likes her gentlemen to not be gentle
was it a mega-dobber or a betting pencil?

oh, that boy's a slag
the best you ever had

where did you go? whoa

you took a left off last laugh lane
you just sounded it out
you're not coming back again

well, the morning was complete
where there was tears on the steering wheel, dripping on the seat
several hours or several weeks
i'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak

it's the beginning of the end 
the car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend
ask anyone, they'll tell you that
it's these times that it tends
to start to breaking up, to start to fall apart
hold on to your heart

and do me a favor, will you break my nose
and do me a favor, and tell me to go away
oh, do me a favor, stop asking questions

well she walked away while her shoes were untied 
when the eyes were all red
you could see that we'd cried 
and i watched, and i waited till she was inside
forcing a smile and waving goodbye

curiosity becomes a heavy load
too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
curiosity becomes a heavy load
too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold

and do me a favor, and ask, if you need some help
she said, do me a favor, and stop flattering yourself
and to tear apart the ties that bind
perhaps 'f*ck off' might be too kind
perhaps 'f*ck off' might be too kind

it might make it worse

oh, the night's like a whirlwind
somebody's girlfriend's talkin' to me, but it's alright
she's sayin' that he's not gonna slap me or try to attack me
he's not the jealous type
and i only need to get half an excuse and i'm away
but when there's no excuses, that's much easier to say
i've been before
and all these capers make her too forward to ignore
well, she's talkin', but i'm not entirely sure, oh

do the bad thing
take off your wedding ring
but it won't make it that much easier
it might make it worse

oh, i'm standing at the bar and somebody's partner's talkin' to me
but i don't know that is what she isn't
she murmurs things to confirm that the tragedy is true
and i knew how she could have anyone she wants
and i'm strugglin' to think of an immediate response

like, i don't mind
be a big mistake
for you to wait
and let me waste your time
really, love, it's fine
really, love, it's fine

and then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy

i knew before the invitation that there was this ploy
oh, but she carried on suggestin' a struggle to refuse
she said, 'it's the red wine this time, but that is no excuse.'
old yellow bricks
love's a risk
quite the little 'escapologist'
looked so miffed
when you wished
for a thousand places better than this

you are the fugitive
but you don't know what you're runnin' from
you can't kid us
and you couldn't trick anyone
houdini, love you don't know what you're runnin' away from

who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
blinded by nostalgia
who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?

she was enraged but the way
that the emperor put traps in the cage
and the days she been dull
lead to nights readin' beer bottles

you're such a fugitive
but you don't know what you're runnin' from
you can't kid us

houdini, love you don't know what you're runnin' away from

you're at a loss
just because
it wasn't all that you thought it was

you are a fugitive, but you don't know what you're runnin' away from

she said, "i want to sleep in the city that never wakes up
and revel in nostalgia."
i know i said he wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up, but
dorothy was right though
i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination you're waiting, lying on your side
with your hands between your thighs

stop and wait a sec
oh, when you look at me like that, my darling
what did you expect?
i probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
or i did last time i checked

not shy of a spark
a knife twists at the thought that i should fall short of the mark
frightened by the bite though it's no harsher than the bark
middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination you're waiting, lying on your side
with your hands between your thighs

but i crumble completely when you cry
it seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
i'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
take my hands off of your eyes too soon

i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination you're waiting, lying on your side
with your hands between your thighs and a smile!

top marks for not trying
so kind of you to bless us
with your effortlessness
we're grateful, so strangely comforted

and i wonder
are you putting us under
'cause we can't take our eyes
off the t-shirt and ties combination?
well, see you later, innovator

some want to kiss, some want to kick you
there's not a net you couldn't slip through
or at least that's the impression i get
'cause you're smooth, and you're wet
and she's not aware yet
but she's yours

she'll be saying, use me
show me the jacuzzi
i imagine that it's there, on a plate
you're whole rendezvous rate
means that you'll never be frightened
to make them wait for a while
i doubt it's your style
not to get what you set
out to acquire the eyes are on fire
you are the unforecasted storm
hup

calm, collected and commanding
(top marks for not trying)
you leave the other stories standing
with your renditions and jokes
bet there's hundreds of blokes
that have wept 'cause you've stolen their

thunder
are you putting us under
'cause we can't take our eyes
off the t-shirt and ties combination

well, see you later, innovator
despair to the point will they provoke
the punchline before they have told the joke
the sheer desperation to be seen
staring at the television screen

despair to the point where they provoke
you to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke
sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
it wasn't in the top one hundred list

and it's the thousandth time, and it's even bolder
don't be surprised when you get bent over
he told ya that you were dying for it

she saw it, and she grabbed it, and it wasn't what it seemed
the kids all dream of making it, whatever that means
another variation on a theme
a tangle on the television and the magazine
do you reckon that they do it for a joke?
do you reckon that they make 'em take an oath
that says 'we are defenders
of any poseur or professional pretender around

when did your list replace the twist and turn
ah, the fist replaced the kissed-on concern
and if you're bothered, i don't want your prayers
save it for the morning after

and it's the thousandth time, and it's even bolder
don't be surprised when you get bent over
he told ya that you were dying for it

let's have a game on the teddy picker
not quick enough, can i have it quicker?
already thick and you're getting thicker

assuming that all things are equal
who'd want to be men of the people
when there's people like you?
he knew what he wanted to say
but he did not want to word it
the dirty little herbert
was thinking an escape
but the place was well guarded
the guiltiness that started
soon as the other part had stopped

d is for delightful
and try and keep your trousers on
i think you should know you're his favorite worst nightmare

d is for desperately trying to simulate what it was that was all right
three quarters of an hour ago
that led him to be in a position
and every copper mission
on every other episode

he's nearing the brink, but he thinks first
the parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene

running off over next doors garden
before the hour is done
it's more a question of feeling
than it is a question of fun
the confidence is the balaclava
i'm sure you'll baffle 'em good
with the ending wreak of salty cheeks
and runny makeup alone

oh, will blood run down the face
of a boy bewildered and scorned
and you'll find yourself in a skirmish
where you wish you'd never been born
you tie yourself to the tracks
and there isn't no going back
and it's wrong, wrong, wrong
but we'll do it anyway 'cause we love a bit of trouble

are you pulling her from a burning building
or throwing her to the sharks?
can only hope that the ending is a pleasurable as the start
the confidence is the balaclava
i'm sure you baffle 'em straight
and it's wrong, wrong, wrong
she can hardly wait

that's right, he won't let her out his sight
now the shaggers perform
and the daggers are drawn
who's the crooks in this crime?

that's right, he won't let her out his sight
how the shaggers perform
and the daggers are drawn
who's the crooks is this...
crime!

that's right, he won't let her out his sight
that's right, he won't let her out his sight
that's right, he won't let her out his sight

you'll be able to post any day of the most
for the sights of all time

you knew that he'd be trouble right before the very first kiss
quiet and unassuming, but you heard that they were the naughtiest
she pleaded with you to take it off
but you resisted and fought
sorry sweetheart abba drava
keep on the balaclava
you used to get it in your fishnets
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
landed in a very common crisis
everything's in order in a black hole
nothing seems as pretty as the past though
that bloody mary's lacking a tabasco
remember when he used to be a rascal?

oh, that boy's a slag
the best you ever had
the best you ever had
is just a memory and those dreams
not as daft as they seem
not as daft as they seem
my love, when you dream them up

flicking through a little book of sex tips
remember when the boys were all electric?
now, when she tells she's gonna get it
i'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
clinging to not getting sentimental
said, she wasn't going, but she went, still
likes her gentlemen to not be gentle
was it a mega-dobber or a betting pencil?

oh, that boy's a slag
the best you ever had

where did you go? whoa

you're falling about
you took a left off last laugh lane
you just sounded it out
you're not coming back again

in a foreign place the saving grace was the feeling
that it was a heart that he was stealing
oh, he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement
the eyes are bright; he couldn't wait to get away
i bet the juliet was just the icing on the cake
make no mistake, no

and even if somehow you could have shown you the place you wanted

well, i'm sure you could have made it that bit better on your own
and i bet she told a million people that she'd stay in touch
well, all the little promises - they don't mean much
when there's memories to be made
and i hope you're holding hands by new years eve
they made it far too easy to believe
that true romance can't be achieved these days

and even if somehow you could have shown you the place you wanted
well, i sure you could have made it that bit better on your own
you are the only ones who know

well, the morning was complete
where there was tears on the steering wheel, dripping on the seat
several hours or several weeks
i'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak

it's the beginning of the end 
the car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend
ask anyone, they'll tell you that
it's these times that it tends
to start to breaking up, to start to fall apart
hold on to your heart

and do me a favor, will you break my nose
and do me a favor, and tell me to go away
oh, do me a favor, stop asking questions

well she walked away while her shoes were untied 
when the eyes were all red
you could see that we'd cried 
and i watched, and i waited till she was inside
forcing a smile and waving goodbye

curiosity becomes a heavy load
too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
curiosity becomes a heavy load
too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold

and i only need to get half an excuse and i'm away
but when there's no excuses, that's much easier to say
i've been before
and all these capers make her too forward to ignore
well, she's talkin', but i'm not entirely sure, oh

do the bad thing
take off your wedding ring
but it won't make it that much easier
it might make it worse

oh, i'm standing at the bar and somebody's partner's talkin' to me
but i don't know that is what she isn't
she murmurs things to confirm that the tragedy is true
and i knew how she could have anyone she wants
and i'm strugglin' to think of an immediate response

like, i don't mind
be a big mistake
for you to wait
and let me waste your time
really, love, it's fine
really, love, it's fine

and then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy

i knew before the invitation that there was this ploy
oh, but she carried on suggestin' a struggle to refuse
she said, 'it's the red wine this time, but that is no excuse.'
old yellow bricks
love's a risk
quite the little 'escapologist'
looked so miffed
when you wished
for a thousand places better than this

you are the fugitive
but you don't know what you're runnin' from
you can't kid us
and you couldn't trick anyone
houdini, love you don't know what you're runnin' away from

who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
blinded by nostalgia
who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?

she wasn't raged but the way
that the emperor put traps in the cage
and the days she been dull
lead to nights readin' beer bottles

you're such a fugitive
but you don't know what you're runnin' from
you can't kid us
and you couldn't trick anyone
houdini, love you don't know what you're runnin' away from

who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
blinded by nostalgia
who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?

you're at a loss
just because
it wasn't all that you thought it was

you are a fugitive, but you don't know what you're runnin' away from

she said, "i want to sleep in the city that never wakes up
and revel in nostalgia."
i know i said he wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up, but
dorothy was right though
i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination you're waiting, lying on your side
with your hands between your thighs

stop and wait a sec
oh, when you look at me like that, my darling
what did you expect?
i probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
or i did last time i checked

not shy of a spark
a knife twists at the thought that i should fall short of the mark
frightened by the bite though it's no harsher than the bark
middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination you're waiting, lying on your side
with your hands between your thighs

but i crumble completely when you cry
it seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
i'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
take my hands off of your eyes too soon

i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination you're waiting, lying on your side
with your hands between your thighs and a smile!
you used to get it in your fishnets
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
landed in a very common crisis
everything's in order in a black hole
nothing seems as pretty as the past though
that bloody mary's lacking a tabasco
remember when he used to be a rascal?

oh, that boy's a slag
the best you ever had
the best you ever had
is just a memory and those dreams
not as daft as they seem
not as daft as they seem
my love, when you dream them up

flicking through a little book of sex tips
remember when the boys were all electric?
now, when she tells she's gonna get it
i'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
clinging to not getting sentimental
said, she wasn't going, but she went, still
likes her gentlemen to not be gentle
was it a mega-dobber or a betting pencil?

oh, that boy's a slag
the best you ever had
the best you ever had
is just a memory, and those dreams
weren't as daft as they seem
not as daft as they seem
my love, when you dream them up
oh, where did you go?
where did you go?
where did you go? whoa

falling about
you took a left off last laugh lane
you just sounded it out
you're not coming back again

i wish you would have smiled in the bakery
or sat on a tatty settee
at a mutual friends gathering

and the more you keep on looking
the more it's hard to take
love we're in stalemate
to never meet is surely where we're bound
there's one in every town
just there to grind you down

i wish i would have seen you in the post office
well maybe i did and i missed it
too busy with the mind on clever lines

why not the rounders pitch or the canteen
you're slacking love were have you been?
just have to go and wait until tonight

to give me the invite
don't worry it's alright

i wish i would have seen you down in the arcade
sippin' on a lemonade
in the paper cup and chewin' on a straw

and i wish i would have seen you in the bakery
but if i'd seen you in the bakery
you probably wouldn't have seen me
he looks as if he hasn't slept
his hair is purposely unkept
and then he know his people wept
when you crafted your plan

shadows underneath the eyes
and everywhere the bastard lies
my lack of proof is your disguise
you won't remember me

there's nothing really i can say
but sorry mate and walk away
i could be wrong unless you play your game

this world is full of most unkind
and horrible is redefined
i can't imagine that you'd mind at all

you're lying again, you're conscience in your friend
and the only thing you're sorting out is your imagination
lying again, your conscience in your friend
and the only thing you're sorting out is your imagination

is he really on the street?
desperation or deceit?
and what he's wearing on his feet
won't solve our mystery

and i am baffled by
how you stand there, soaking it in
and do you hide your identity
where you hide your grin? better hide your grin

shadows underneath the eyes
everywhere the bastard lies
my lack of proof is your disguise
you won't remember me

there's nothing really i can say
but sorry mate and walk away
i could be wrong unless you play your game

this world is full of most unkind
and horrible is redefined
i can't imagine that you'd mind at all

you're lying again, your conscience in your friend
and the only thing you're sorting out is your imagination
lying again, conscience in your friend
and the only thing you're sorting out is your imagination

the smiles as she walked in the room
have all turned into frowns am i too quick to assume
that the love is no longer in bloom?
the tantrums and the tears play a very different tune

to what they did before, her heads red raw
and the ending doesn't sound like they're happiest around
when you sobbed before it felt much more like the product of a squabble
now there's reason for it to be something more

and no would be, oh, it's uncertain
whether the curtain has shut for good
she says, "see if it's still raining
i'm not dressed for it and if you loved me"
and i interrupt to receive the scowl and stare
but still decided to stop her there

would it be outrageous to say
we're either shouting or we're shagging?
locked in tempestuous phase
at least that's how we felt yesterday
the eyes are getting heavier and whether you're asleep or awake is a mystery

would a kiss be too much to ask?
when you fit me as sunday's frozen pitch
fits the thermos flask
it's a pity, it just hit me, we can't go back
to the chest touching on the back
meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
you say why did you do it with him today?
and sniff me out like i was tanqueray

'cause you're my fella, my guy
hand me your stella and fly
by the time i'm out the door
you tear me down like roger moore

i cheated myself
like i knew i would
i told ya, i was troubled
you know that i'm no good

upstairs in bed, with my ex boy
he's in the place, but i can't get joy
thinking of you in the final throws,
this is when my buzzer goes

run out to meet your chicks and bitter
you say when we're married cause you're not bitter
there'll be none of him no more
i cried for you on the kitchen floor

i cheated myself
like i knew i would
i told ya, i was troubled
you know that i'm no good

sweet reunion, jamaica and spain
we're like how we were again
i'm in the tub you're on the seat
lick your lips as i soak my feet

then you notice lickle carpet burn
my stomach drops and my guts churn
you shrug and it's the worst
to truly stuck the knife in first

i cheated myself
like i knew i would
i told ya, i was troubled
you know that i'm no good

i cheated myself
like i knew i would
i told ya, i was troubled
you know that i'm no good
stop making the eyes at me
i'll stop making the eyes at you
what it is that surprises me
is that i don't really want you to

and your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
your name isn't rio, but i don't care for sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
well, from 1984

i wish you'd stop ignoring me
because you're sending me to despair
without a sound, yeah, you're calling me
and i don't think it's very fair

that your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
your name isn't rio, but i don't care for sand

i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor

well, from 1984

oh, there ain't no love, no montagues or capulets
just banging tunes and dj sets and
dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness!

well, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or

there's always somebody taller with more of a wit 
and he's equipped to enthrall her and her friends think he's fit
and you just can't measure up though, you don't have a prayer
wishing that you'd made the most of her when she was there 

they've got engaged, there's no intention of a wedding 
he's pinched your bird and he'd probably kick your head in 

bigger boys and stolen sweethearts 
oh, you're better off without her anyway 
you said you wasn't sad to see her go 
yeah, but i know you were though

now you don't know what she's up to, you can only assume
if she's not in the front of the shops then they've gone to his room
bet she's gone 'round in her school stuff, bet that's what he likes
i know you thought she were different and you thought she were nice

but she's not nice, she's pretty fucking far from nice
she's looking at you funny rarely looking at you twice

bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
oh, you're better off without her anyway
you said you wasn't sad to see her go
yeah, but it's so clear you were though 

have you heard what she's been doing? never did it for me 
he picks her up at the school gates at twenty past three 
she's been with all of the boys but never went very far 
and she wagged english and science just to go in his car 

they've got engaged, there's no intention of a wedding 
he's pinched my bird and he'd probably kick my head in 
oh, now the girls have grown 
yeah, but i'm sure that they still carry on in similar ways 

bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
oh, you're better off without her anyway
you said you wasn't sad to see her go
yeah, but i'm only pretending, you know 
yeah, i'm only pretending, you know 
i was only pretending, you know 
i was only pretending, you know
well, this is a good idea
he wouldn't do it if it wasn't
he wouldn't do it if it wasn't one

well, my friend fancies you
oh, what a way to begin it all
you said they're always exciting words to hear

they woke up together
not quite realizing how
awkwardly stretching and yawning
it's always hard in the morning

and i suppose that's the price you pay
well, oh, it isn't what it was
she's thinking he looks different today
and oh, there's nothing left to guess now

they left before the lights came on
because they didn't want to ruin
what it was that was brewing
before they absolutely had to

and how can you wake up
with someone you don't love?
and not feel slightly phased by it
oh, he had a struggle

they woke up together
not quite realizing how
awkwardly stretching and yawning
it's always hard in the morning

and i suppose that's the price you pay
well, oh, it isn't what it was
she's thinking he looks different today
and oh, there's nothing left to guess now

quick, let's leave
before the lights come on
'cause then you don't have to see
'cause then you don't have to see what you've done

quick, let's leave
before the lights come on
'cause then you don't have to see
'cause then you don't have to see what you've done

i'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
i'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
i'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?

so who's that girl there? 
i wonder what went wrong
so that she had to roam the streets
she don't do major credit cards
i doubt she does receipts
it's all not quite legitimate
and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes, yeah
that he's got a driving ban
amongst some other offences

and i've seen him with girls of the night
he told roxanne to put on her red light
they're all infected but he'll be alright
'cause he's a scumbag, don't you know
i said he's a scumbag, don't you know! 

although you're trying not to listen
i bet your eyes are staring at the ground
she makes a subtle proposition
i'm sorry love i'll have to turn you down

and oh he must be up to something
want half a chance to show he's more than likely
i've got a feeling in my stomach
i start to wonder what his story might be
what his story might be

they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here
around, here

and look here comes a ford mondeo
isn't he mister inconspicuous
and he don't have to say 'owt
she's in the stance ready to get picked up

and she's delighted when she sees him
pulling in and giving her the eye
because she must be fucking freezing
scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
and don't stop in the winter no and

they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here

they said it changes when the sun goes down
over the river going out of town
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here
around here

and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes that he's got a nasty plan
i hope you're not involved at all

oh there ain't no love no, montagues or capulets
just banging tunes 'n' dj sets 'n'
dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness!

well i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if your looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said i bet that you look good on the dance floor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
from 1984!
fake tales of san francisco
echo through the room
more point to a wedding disco
without a bride or groom
there's a super cool band yeah
with their trilbys and their glasses of white wine
and all the weekend rockstars are in the toilets
practicing their lines

i don't want to hear you
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear, you know
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you
i don't want to hear your

fake tales of san francisco
echo through the air
and there's a few bored faces at the back
all wishing they weren't there

and as the microphone squeaks
a young girl's telephone beeps
yeah she's dashing for the exit
oh she's running to the streets outside
"oh you've saved me," she screams down the line
"the band were fucking wank
and i'm not having a nice time"

i don't want to hear you
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear, you know
(kick me out, kick me out)

yeah but his bird said it's amazing, though
so all that's left
is the proof that love's not only blind but deaf

he talks of san francisco, he's from hunter's bar
i don't quite know the distance
but i'm sure that's far
yeah i'm sure it's pretty far

and yeah, i'd love to tell you all my problem
you're not from new york city, you're from rotherham
so get off the bandwagon, and put down the handbook
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get on your dancing shoes
there's one thing on your mind
hoping they're looking for you
sure you'll be rummaging through

and the shit, shock, horror
you've seen your future bride
oh, but it's oh so absurd
for you to say the first word
so you're waiting and waiting

the only reason that you came
so what you scared for
don't you always do the same
it's what you there for, don't you know

the lights are flashing
down in here tonight
and some might exchange a glance
but keep pretending to dance

don't act like it's not happening
as if it's impolite
to go and mention your name
instead you'll just do the same
as they all do, and hope for the best ...

the only reason that you came
so what you scared for
well don't you always do the same
it's what you're there for but no

get on your dancing shoes
you sexy little swine
hoping they're looking for you
sure you'll be rummaging through

oh and the shit, shock, horror
you've seen your future bride
oh, but it's oh so absurd
for you to say the first word
so you're waiting and waiting
one look sends it coursing through the veins oh how the feeling races
back up to their brains to form expressions on there stupid faces
they don't want to say hello
like i want to say hello
oh the heartbeats at its peak when you're coming up to speak

and i'm so tense, never tenser
could all go a bit frank spencer? 
i'm talking gibberish, tip of the tongue but i can't deliver it
properly, oh it's all getting on top of me
and if it weren't this dark you'd see how red my face has gone

everybody's trying to crack the jokes and that to make you smile
those that claim that they're not showing off are drowning in denial
they're not half as bad as me say anything and i'll agree
'cause when it comes to acting up, i'm sure i could write the book

and now that you're more than a part in the play
it's slightly easier to think what to say
you had us all, standing on our heads
doing our best tricks

never again
never again, will there be another one that's as desirable as you

one look sends it coursing through the veins oh how the feeling races
back up to their brains to form expressions on there stupid faces
well, it's ever so funny
'cause i don't think you're special, i don't think you're cool
you're just probably alright
but under these lights you look beautiful
and i'm struggling, i can't see through your fake tan
yeah, and you know it for a fact that everybody's eating out of your hands

but what do you know?
oh, you know nothing
yeah, but i'll still take you home
oh, yeah, i'll still take you home
so what do you know?
said, you don't know nothing

well, fancy seeing you in here
you're all tarted up and you don't look the same
well, i haven't seen you since last year
yeah, and surprisingly you have forgotten my name
but you know it, yeah, and you knew it all along
oh and you say you have forgotten but you're fibbing, go on, tell me i'm wrong

so what do you know?
oh, you know nothing
yeah, but i'll still take you home
oh, yeah, i'll still take you home
so what do you know?
oh, you don't know nothing, no

oh-woah, woah, woah
oh-woah, woah, woah
da-da, da-da-da, da-da, da-da
da-da, da-da, da-da-da
oh-woah, woah, woah

oh, so what do you know?
yeah, you don't know nothing, no
yeah, but i'd still take you home
oh, yeah, i'll still take you home
i said, what do you know?
oh, you don't know nothing

i fancy you with a passion
oh, you're a topshop princess, a rockstar, too
but you're a fad and you're a fashion
and i'm having a job trying to talk to you
but it's alright, yeah, i'll put it on one side
oh, 'cause everybody's looking, you've got control of everyone's eyes including mine
so up rolls a riot van
and sparks excitement in the boys
but the policemen look annoyed
perhaps these are ones they should avoid

got chased last night
from men with truncheons dressed in hats
we didn't do that much wrong
still ran away though for the laugh
just for the laugh
and please just stop talking cause they won't find us if you do
oh those silly boys in blue
well they won't catch me and you

have you been drinking son, you don't look old enough to me
i'm sorry officer, is there a certain age you're supposed to be, cause nobody told me

and up rolls the riot van
and these lads just wind the coppers up
they ask why they don't catch proper crooks
they get their address and their names took
but they couldn't care less

thrown in a riot van
and all the coppers kicked him in
and there was no way he could win
just had to take it on the chin
we'll ask if we can have six in
if not we'll have to have two
well, you're coming up our end, aren't you?
so i'll get one with you
won't he let us have six in?
especially not with the food
he could have just told us no though
he didn't have to be rude

you see her with the green dress?
she talked to me at the bar
wait, how come it's already two pound fifty?
we've only gone about a yard
didn't you see she were gorgeous
she were beyond belief
but this lad at her side drinking his smirnoff ice
came and paid for her tropical reef

and i'm sitting going backwards
and i didn't want to leave
i said, "it's high green, mate
via hillsborough, please"

well, how funny were that sketch earlier
up near that taxi rank?
oh no, you would have missed it
think it were when you went to the bank
these two lads squaring up proper shouting
'bout who were next in the queue
the kind of thing that'd seem so silly
but not when they've both had a few

well calm down, temper, temper
you shouldn't get so annoyed
well, you're acting like a silly little boy
and they wanted to be men
and do some fighting in the street
they said "no surrender
no chance of retreat"

and so why are they in the taxi?
'cause i didn't want to leave
i said, "it's high green, mate
via hillsborough, please"

drunken plots hatched to jump it
ask around, "are you sure?"
went for it but the red light was showing
and red light indicates doors are secured
now then mardy bum
i see your frown
and it's like looking down the barrel of a gun
and it goes off
and out come all these words
oh there's a very pleasant side to you
a side i much prefer
it's one that laughs and jokes around
remember cuddles in the kitchen
yeah, to get things off the ground
and it was up, up and away
oh, but it's right hard to remember
that on a day like today when you're all argumentative
and you've got the face on

well now then mardy bum
oh i'm in trouble again, aren't i
i thought as much
cause you turned over there
pulling that silent disappointment face
the one that i can't bare

can't we laugh and joke around
remember cuddles in the kitchen
yeah, to get things off the ground
and it was up, up and away
oh, but it's right hard to remember
that on a day like today when you're all argumentative
and you've got the face on

yeah i'm sorry i was late
well i missed the train
and then the traffic was a state
and i can't be arsed to carry on in this debate
that reoccurs ,oh when you say i don't care
well of course i do, yeah i clearly do!

so laugh and joke around
remember cuddles in the kitchen
yeah, to get things off the ground
and it was up, up and away
still it's right hard to remember
that on a day like today when you're all argumentative
and you've got the face on
i've seen your eyes as they fix on me
what is he doing
what on earth's the plan, has he got one
you better give me some pointers since you are the big rocket launcher and i'm just the shotgun

well i ain't got no dollar signs in my eyes
that might be a surprise but it's true
i'm not like you and i don't want your advice or your praise or to move in the ways you do
and i never will

'cause all you people are vampires
and all your stories are stale
and though you pretend to stand by us
i know you're certain we'll fail

i've seen your eyes as they fix on me
full of confusion
your snarl is just so condescending
try to explain that we're on to a win
if the fee we got in
near recoups what we're spending

he said
i can't believe that you drove all that way
well how much did they pay you, how much did they pay you?
you'd have been better to stay round our way
thinking about things but not actually doing the things

'cause all you people are vampires
and all your stories are stale
and though you pretend to stand by us
i know you're certain we'll fail

'cause all you people are vampires
and all your stories are stale
and though you pretend to stand by us
i know you're certain we'll fail

all you people are vampires
so who's that girl there? 
i wonder what went wrong
so that she had to roam the streets
she don't do major credit cards
i doubt she does receipts
it's all not quite legitimate
and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes, yeah
that he's got a driving ban
amongst some other offences

and i've seen him with girls of the night
he told roxanne to put on her red light
they're all infected but he'll be alright
'cause he's a scumbag, don't you know
i said he's a scumbag, don't you know! 

although you're trying not to listen
i bet your eyes are staring at the ground
she makes a subtle proposition
i'm sorry love i'll have to turn you down

and oh he must be up to something
want half a chance to show he's more than likely
i've got a feeling in my stomach
i start to wonder what his story might be
what his story might be

they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here
around, here

and look here comes a ford mondeo
isn't he mister inconspicuous
and he don't have to say 'owt
she's in the stance ready to get picked up

and she's delighted when she sees him
pulling in and giving her the eye
because she must be fucking freezing
scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
and don't stop in the winter no and

they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here

they said it changes when the sun goes down
over the river going out of town
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here
around here

and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes that he's got a nasty plan
i hope you're not involved at all
well, last night these two bouncers
and one of 'em's alright, the other one's the scary one
his way or no way, he totalitarian
he's got no time for you looking or breathing
how he don’t want you to, so step out the queue
he makes examples of you and there's nowt you can say
behind they go through to the bit where you pay
and you realise then that it's finally the time
to walk back past ten-thousand eyes in the line
and you can swap jumpers and make another move
instilled in your brain, you've got something to prove
to all the smirking faces and the boys in black
why can't they be pleasant? why can't they have a laugh?
he's got his hand in your chest, he wants to give you a duff
well, secretly i think they want it all to kick off
they want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well
it's just something to talk about, a story to tell, yeah

well, i'm so glad they turned us all away
we'll put it down to fate
i said a thousand million things
that i could never say this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

well, this town's a different town today
said, this town's a different town to what it was last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday
and that girl's a different girl today
said, that girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday, of course not

well, i'm so glad they turned us all away
we'll put it down to fate
i thought a thousand million things
that i could never think this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

last night, what we talked about
it made so much sense
but now the haze has ascended
it don't make no sense anymore
i said, last night, what we talked about
it made so much sense
but now the haze has ascended
it don't make no sense anymore, oh

da-da, da-da-da
da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
well oh they might wear classic reeboks
or knackered converse
or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
but all of that's what the point is not
the point's that there ain't no romance around there

and there's the truth that they can't see
they'd probably like to throw a punch at me
and if you could only see them, then you would agree
agree that there ain't no romance around there

you know, oh it's a funny thing you know
we'll tell 'em if you like
we'll tell 'em all tonight
they'll never listen
because their minds are made up
and 'course it's all okay to carry on that way

and over there, there's broken bones
there's only music, so that there's new ringtones
and it don't take no sherlock holmes
to see it's a little different around here

don't get me wrong, oh there's boys in bands
and kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
and just 'cause he's had a couple o' cans
he thinks it's all right to act like a dickhead

don't you know, oh it's a funny thing you know
we'll tell em if you like
we'll tell em all tonight
they'll never listen
because their minds are made up
and 'course it's all okay to carry on that way

i said no
oh no
oh you won't get me to go
anywhere, said anywhere
i won't go
oh no no

well over there, there's friends of mine
what can i say? i've known 'em for a long long time
and yeah they might overstep the line
but i just cannot get angry in the same way
not in the same way
not in the same way
oh no, oh no no
so who's that girl there? 
i wonder what went wrong
so that she had to roam the streets
she don't do major credit cards
i doubt she does receipts
it's all not quite legitimate

i'd never wrote it down before. 
i was gonna bring over like something from a film but 
i didn't have the bottle at all. 

well i had a look and you kept staring. 
your head pairing up with mine 
cos your so pretty and i'm so shy. 
you proper did give me the eye though im sure you did 
well i went outside, couldn't say i tried. 
and i felt regret. 
but in a flash yeah i'd dashed back in. 
cos the ship had'nt sailed yet. 

and when i did i couldn't see your face 
i could see your mates but that wouldn't do. 
i dashed around to find you 
but you were nowhere to be seen 
oh no no 

na na na na na na na na na na na 
na na na na na na na na na na na 
na na na na na na na na na na na

well yeah she flew away. 
she seemed like weeks or months away. 
(missing lines) 

yeah but i learned my lesson though. 
your so pretty and i'm so shy 
anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus yeah regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen
the lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
of course it's fancy dress
and they're all looking quite forlorn in bunny ears and devil horns and how

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus yeah regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen
i wanna see you take the jackpot out the fruit machine
and put it all back in
you've got to understand that you can never beat the bandit, no

and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
when she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
and there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
and all that is said is that you've drank a lot

and you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind yeah
you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind

and you can pour your heart out
for a reason it would block
oh you send her after nine o' clock

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus yeah regardless of what's gone before

and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
when she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
and there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
and all that is said is that you've drank a lot

and you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind yeah
you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind

and you can pour your heart out
around three o' clock
when the two-for-ones have done the writer's block
sat at the side of the pool at one of your houses
with wet white trousers on
and worlds collide as the evening continues, the dignity fucks off
her brother's gone off to the strippers to make up for all the lost time
she could have been one of the bitches but she's actually alright

cigarette smoker, i'm sorry
but we're all unsure how much you've had
but we think that you outta maybe not have anymore

a country home, even if we really tried
would it cease to surprise us now
and i bet your dad would like to give us all a slap
when are your parents back d'ya know?

well, i never came from no ghetto
but it wasn't nowhere near here
well, spoken girls and stilettos
aren't something to fear

cigarette smoker, i'm sorry
but we're all unsure how much you've had
but we think that you outta maybe not have anymore

cigarette smoker, i'm sorry
but we're all unsure how much you've had
but we think that you outta maybe not have anymore

cigarette smoker, cigarette smoke doesn't hide
as well as you think
and you think that it outta act as the perfect disguise

he's pining for her in a people carrier
there might be buildings and pretty things to see like that
but architecture won't do

although it might say a lot about the city or town
i don't care what they've got, keep on turning them down
it don't say the funny things she does
don't even try and cheer him up, because it just won't happen

he's got the feeling again, this time on the aero plane
there might be tellies in the back of the seats in front
but rodney and del won't do

although it might take your mind off the aches and the pains
laugh when he falls through the bar but you're feeling the same
'cause she isn't there to hold your hand
she won't be waiting for you when you land

it feels like she's just nowhere near
you could well be out on your ear
this thought comes closely followed by the fear
and the thoughts of it makes you feel a bit ill

yesterday i saw a girl who looked like someone
you might knock about with
and almost shouted

and then reality kicked in within us
it seems as we become the winners
you lose a bit of summat
and half wonder if you won it at all

and don't say ow 'cause you've got no idea
and she's still nowhere near
and the thought comes closely followed by the fear
and the thoughts of it makes you feel a bit ill

despair in the departure lounge
it's one and they'll still be around at three
no signal and low battery, what's happened to me?
lady where's your love gone?
i was looking but can't find it anywhere
they always offer when there's loads of love around
but when you're short of some it's nowhere to be found

well, i know your game, you told him yesterday
?no chance, you'll get nothing from me?
but now she's there, you're there and everybody's there
and he's in turmoil as puzzled as can be, just like me

let's go down, down low down
where i know i should not go
oh, and she thinks she's the one
but she's just one in twenty-four
and just 'cause everybody's doing it
does that mean that i can too?

lady where's your love gone?
it was the antiseptic to the sore
to hold you by the hand must he first be in demand?
how he longs for you to long for him once more, just once more

let's go down, down low down
where i know i should not go
oh, and she thinks she's the one
but she's just one in twenty-four
and just 'cause everybody's doing it
does that mean that i can too?

her eyes went down and cut you up
and there's nothing like a dirty look from
the one you want or the one you've lost

an ache in your soul it's everybody's goal
to get what they can't have
that's why you're after her and that's why she's after him
but saying it won't change a thing
and now realizing it won't change a thing
realizing it won't change a thing

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus yeah regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen
the lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
of course it's fancy dress
and they're all looking quite forlorn in bunny ears and devil horns and how

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus yeah regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen
i wanna see you take the jackpot out the fruit machine
and put it all back in
you've got to understand that you can never beat the bandit, no

and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
when she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
and there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
and all that is said is that you've drank a lot

and you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind yeah
you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind

and you can pour your heart out
for a reason it would block
oh you send her after nine o' clock

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus yeah regardless of what's gone before

and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
when she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
and there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
and all that is said is that you've drank a lot

and you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind yeah
you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind

and you can pour your heart out
around three o' clock
when the two-for-ones have done the writer's block
sat at the side of the pool at one of your houses
with wet white trousers on
and worlds collide as the evening continues, the dignity fucks off
her brother's gone off to the strippers to make up for all the lost time
she could have been one of the bitches but she's actually alright

cigarette smoker, i'm sorry
but we're all unsure how much you've had
but we think that you outta maybe not have anymore

a country home, even if we really tried
would it cease to surprise us now
and i bet your dad would like to give us all a slap
when are your parents back d'ya know?

well, i never came from no ghetto
but it wasn't nowhere near here
well, spoken girls and stilettos
aren't something to fear

cigarette smoker, i'm sorry
but we're all unsure how much you've had
but we think that you outta maybe not have anymore

cigarette smoker, i'm sorry
but we're all unsure how much you've had
but we think that you outta maybe not have anymore

cigarette smoker, cigarette smoke doesn't hide
as well as you think
and you think that it outta act as the perfect disguise

lady where's your love gone?
i was looking but can't find it anywhere
they always offer when there's loads of love around
but when you're short of some it's nowhere to be found

well, i know your game, you told him yesterday
?no chance, you'll get nothing from me?
but now she's there, you're there and everybody's there
and he's in turmoil as puzzled as can be, just like me

let's go down, down low down
where i know i should not go
oh, and she thinks she's the one
but she's just one in twenty-four
and just 'cause everybody's doing it
does that mean that i can too?

lady where's your love gone?
it was the antiseptic to the sore
to hold you by the hand must he first be in demand?
how he longs for you to long for him once more, just once more

let's go down, down low down
where i know i should not go
oh, and she thinks she's the one
but she's just one in twenty-four
and just 'cause everybody's doing it
does that mean that i can too?

her eyes went down and cut you up
and there's nothing like a dirty look from
the one you want or the one you've lost

an ache in your soul it's everybody's goal
to get what they can't have
that's why you're after her and that's why she's after him
but saying it won't change a thing
and now realizing it won't change a thing
realizing it won't change a thing
we all want some one to shout for
yeah, everyone wants somebody to adore
but heroes aren't what they seem
when you've been, where we've been

have i done something to trigger
the funny looks and the sniggers
are they there at all
or is it just paranoia

everybody's got there box
and doing what they're told
you push my faith near being lost
but we'll stick to the guns

don't care if it's marketing suicide
we won't crack or compromise
your derisory divides
will never unhinge us

and there's a couple of hundred
think they're christopher columbus
but the settlers had already settled
here long before you

just because we're having a say so
not lining up to be play-doh
in five years time will it be
who the f*ck's arctic monkeys?

'cause everybody's got there box
and doing what they're told
you push my faith near being lost
but we'll stick to the guns

don't care if it's marketing suicide
we won't crack or compromise
your derisory divides
will never unhinge us

all the thoughts that i just said
linger round and multiply in the head
not that bad to start with
i'm not angry, i'm just disappointed

it's not you it's them that are wrong
tell 'em to take out their tongues
tell 'em to take out their tongues

it's not you it's them that are wrong
tell 'em to take out their tongues
tell 'em to take out their tongues
and bring on the backlash

it's not you it's them that are wrong
tell him to take out his tongue
tell him to take out his tongue

it's not you it's them that's the fake
i won't mess with your escape
is this really your escape, yeah?
fake tales of san francisco
echo through the room
more point to a wedding disco
without a bride or groom
there's a super cool band yeah
with their trilbys and their glasses of white wine
and all the weekend rockstars are in the toilets
practicing their lines

i don't want to hear you
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear, you know
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you
i don't want to hear your

fake tales of san francisco
echo through the air
and there's a few bored faces at the back
all wishing they weren't there

and as the microphone squeaks
a young girl's telephone beeps
yeah she's dashing for the exit
oh she's running to the streets outside
"oh you've saved me," she screams down the line
"the band were fucking wank
and i'm not having a nice time"

i don't want to hear you
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear, you know
(kick me out, kick me out)

yeah but his bird said it's amazing, though
so all that's left
is the proof that love's not only blind but deaf

he talks of san francisco, he's from hunter's bar
i don't quite know the distance
but i'm sure that's far
yeah i'm sure it's pretty far

and yeah, i'd love to tell you all my problem
you're not from new york city, you're from rotherham
so get off the bandwagon, and put down the handbook
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
last night these two bouncers
and one of em's alright
the other one's the scary one
his way or no way, totalitarian

he's got no time for you
looking or breathing
how he don't want you to

so step out the queue
he makes examples of you
and there's now you can say
behind they go through to the bit where you pay
and you realize then that it's finally the time
to walk back past ten thousand eyes in the line

and you can swap jumpers and make another move
instilled in your brain you've got something to prove
to all the smirking faces and the boys in black
why can't they be pleasant?
why can't they have a laugh?

he's got his hand in your chest
he wants to give you a duff
well secretly i think they want it all to kick off
they want, arms flying everywhere and
bottles as well it's just
something to talk about
a story to tell you

well i'm so glad they turned us all away we'll put it down to fate
i said a thousand million things that i could never say this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?
this town's a different town today
this town's a different town to what it was last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday

that girl's a different girl today
said that girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday

well i'm so glad they turned us all away we'll put it down to fate
i said a thousand million things that i could never say this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?
last night what we talked about
it made so much sense
but now the haze has ascended
it don't make no sense anymore
we'll ask if we can have six in
if not we'll have to have two
well, you're coming up our end, aren't you?
so i'll get one with you
won't he let us have six in?
especially not with the food
he could have just told us no though
he didn't have to be rude

you see her with the green dress?
she talked to me at the bar
wait, how come it's already two pound fifty?
we've only gone about a yard
didn't you see she were gorgeous
she were beyond belief
but this lad at her side drinking his smirnoff ice
came and paid for her tropical reef

and i'm sitting going backwards
and i didn't want to leave
i said, "it's high green, mate
via hillsborough, please"

well, how funny were that sketch earlier
up near that taxi rank?
oh no, you would have missed it
think it were when you went to the bank
these two lads squaring up proper shouting
'bout who were next in the queue
the kind of thing that'd seem so silly
but not when they've both had a few

well calm down, temper, temper
you shouldn't get so annoyed
well, you're acting like a silly little boy
and they wanted to be men
and do some fighting in the street
they said "no surrender
no chance of retreat"

and so why are they in the taxi?
'cause i didn't want to leave
i said, "it's high green, mate
via hillsborough, please"

drunken plots hatched to jump it
ask around, "are you sure?"
went for it but the red light was showing
and red light indicates doors are secured
have you got color in your cheeks'
do you ever get the feeling that you can't shift the tide
that sticks around like something's in your teeth
and some aces up your sleeve
i had no idea that you're in deep
i dreamt about you near me every night this week
how many secrets can you keep'
'cause there's this tune i found that makes me think of you somehow
when i play it on repeat
until i fall asleep
spilling drinks on my settee

(do i wanna know?)
if this feeling flows both ways
(sad to see you go)
was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(baby we both know)
that the nights were mainly made for saying
things that you can't say tomorrow day

crawlin' back to you.

ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'cause i always do
maybe i'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
now i've thought it through

crawling back to you

so have you got the guts?
been wondering if your heart's still open and
if so i wanna know what time it shuts
simmer down and pucker up
i'm sorry to interrupt it's just i'm constantly
on the cusp of trying to kiss you
i don't know if you feel the same as i do
but we could be together, if you wanted to

(do i wanna know?)
if this feeling flows both ways
(sad to see you go)
was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(baby we both know)
that the nights were mainly made for saying
things that you can't say tomorrow day

crawling back to you

ever thought of calling when you've had a few? (calling when you've had a few)
'cause i always do ('cause i always do)
maybe i'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
now i've thought it through

crawling back to you, (do i wanna know?)
if this feeling flows both ways
(sad to see you go)
was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(baby we both know)
that the nights were mainly made for saying
things that you can't say tomorrow day

(do i wanna know?)
too busy being yours to fall
(sad to see you go)
ever thought of calling darling?
(do i wanna know)
do you want me crawling back to you?

one for the road, ooh ooh
one for the road, ooh ooh

from the bottom of your heart
the relegation zone
i saw this coming from the start
the shake, rattle and roll
the cracks in blackout blinds
cast patterns on the ceiling but you're feeling fine
i thought it was dark outside
i thought it was dark outside

so we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me round baby, i feel like i've been in here before
i've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
will you pour me one for the road?

i knew this would be on the cards
i knew you wouldn't fold
i saw this coming from the start
the shake, rattle and roll

one for the road, ooh ooh

so we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me round baby, i feel like i've been in here before
i've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
will you pour me one for the road?

the mixture hits you hard
don't get that sinking feeling, don't fall apart
some out of tune guitar
soundtrack to disaster

ooh ooh, one for the road
ooh ooh, one for the road
ooh ooh, one for the road
ooh ooh, one for the road

so we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me round baby, i feel like i've been in here before
i've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
will you pour me one for the road?
stop making the eyes at me
i'll stop making the eyes at you
what it is that surprises me
is that i don't really want you to

and your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
your name isn't rio, but i don't care for sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
well, from 1984

i wish you'd stop ignoring me
because you're sending me to despair
without a sound, yeah, you're calling me
and i don't think it's very fair

that your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
your name isn't rio, but i don't care for sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
well, from 1984

oh, there ain't no love, no montagues or capulets
just banging tunes and dj sets and
dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness!

well, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984

i ain't quite where i think i am
thinking back
by the retina scan
and i've been given a reason to believe
i ain't quite where i think i am
but it's always worth half a wait
you know the face but you can't see past
the disco strobes in the stumbling blocks
wait, there's the other island now

formation displays of affection fly over (eyes roll back)
and i can see both islands now

it's the intermission
let's shake a few hands
blank expressions invite me to suspect
i ain't quite where i think i am
stackable party games
to fill the awkward silences
the disco strobes in the stumbling blocks
wait, there's the other island now

formation displays of affection fly over (eyes roll back)
and i can see both islands now

from my vantage point
a spare set of tingles will race up your spine, if i get it my way

looks like the riviera
just coming into land
but predictions would seem to suggest
that i ain't quite where i think i am

formation displays of affection flying over (eyes roll back)
and i can see both islands now
brian
top marks for not trying
so kind of you to bless us
with your effortlessness
we're grateful and so strangely comforted
and i wonder
are you putting us under
'cause we can't take our eyes
off the t-shirt and ties combination?
well, see you later, innovator

we are the arctic monkeys from high green, baby

some want to kiss, some want to kick you
there's not a net you couldn't slip through
or at least that's the impression i get
'cause you're smooth, and you're wet
and she's not aware yet
but she's yours
she'll be saying, "use me
show me the jacuzzi"
i imagine that it's there on a plate
your whole rendezvous rate
means that you'll never be frightened
to make them wait for a while
i doubt it's your style
not to get what you set
out to acquire, the eyes are on fire
you are the unforecasted storm

(brian) calm, collected and commanding
(top marks for not trying)
you leave the other stories standing
with your renditions and jokes
bet there's hundreds of blokes
that have wept 'cause you've stolen their

thunder
are you putting us under
'cause we can't take our eyes
off the t-shirt and ties combination?

well, see you later, innovator

i thought i saw you in the battleship
but it was only a look alike
she was nothing but a vision trick
under the warning light
she was close
close enough to be your ghost
but my chances turned to toast
when i asked her if i could call her your name

i thought i saw you in the rusty hook
huddled up in wicker chair
i wandered up for a closer look
and kissed whoever was sitting there
she was close
and she held me very tightly
'til i asked awfully politely
"please, can i call you her name?"

and i elongated my lift home
yeah, i let him go the long way 'round
i smelt your scent on the seatbelt
and kept my shortcuts to myself

i thought i saw you in the parrot's beak
messin' with the smoke alarm
it was too loud for me to hear her speak
and she had a broken arm
it was close
so close that the walls were wet
and she wrote it out in letraset
"no, you can't call me her name"

tell me, where's your hiding place?
i'm worried i'll forget your face
and i've asked everyone
i'm beginning to think i imagined you all along

i elongated my lift home
yeah, i let him go the long way 'round
i smelt your scent on the seatbelt
and kept my shortcuts to myself

i saw your sister in the cornerstone
on the phone to the middle man
when i saw that she was on her own
i thought she might understand
that she was close
well, you couldn't get much closer
she said, "i'm really not supposed to, but yes
you can call me anything you want"

i dance in my underpants
i'm gonna run for government
i'm gonna form a covers band and all
a-back there by the baby grand
did mr. winter wonderland say
"come here, kid, we really need to talk"?
bear with me, man, i lost my train of thought

i fantasize, i call it quits
i swim with the economists
and i get to the bottom of it for good
by the time reality hits
the chimes of freedom fell to bits
the shining city on the fritz
they all come out of the cracks, thirsty for blood

oh, just as the apocalypse finally gets prioritized 
and you cried some of the hottest tears you ever cried
multiplied by five
i suppose the singer must die

(woo)

singsong 'round the money tree
this stunning documentary
that no one else unfortunately saw
such beautiful photography
it's worth it for the opening scene
i've been driving 'round listening to the score
or maybe, i just imagined it all
i've played to quiet rooms like this before
bear with me, man, i lost my train of thought
he's pining for her in a people carrier
there might be buildings and pretty things to see like that
but architecture won't do

although it might say a lot about the city or town
i don't care what they've got, keep on turning them down
it don't say the funny things she does
don't even try and cheer him up, because it just won't happen

he's got the feeling again, this time on the aero plane
there might be tellies in the back of the seats in front
but rodney and del won't do

although it might take your mind off the aches and the pains
laugh when he falls through the bar but you're feeling the same
'cause she isn't there to hold your hand
she won't be waiting for you when you land

it feels like she's just nowhere near
you could well be out on your ear
this thought comes closely followed by the fear
and the thoughts of it makes you feel a bit ill

yesterday i saw a girl who looked like someone
you might knock about with
and almost shouted

and then reality kicked in within us
it seems as we become the winners
you lose a bit of summat
and half wonder if you won it at all

and don't say ow 'cause you've got no idea
and she's still nowhere near
and the thought comes closely followed by the fear
and the thoughts of it makes you feel a bit ill

despair in the departure lounge
it's one and they'll still be around at three
no signal and low battery, what's happened to me?
just when things are getting complicated
in the eye of the storm
she flicks a red-hot revelation
off the tip of her tongue
it does a dozen somersaults
and leaves you supercharged
makes me wanna blow the candles out
just to see if you glow in the dark

shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
shalalala

home sweet home, home sweet home
home sweet booby trap
i took the batteries out my mysticism
and put them in my thinking cap
she's got a telescopic hallelujah
hanging up on the wall
for when it gets too complicated
in the eye of the storm

shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
ah

and in a hellcat spangled cavern
when your judgment's on the run
and you're acting like a stranger
'cause you thought it looked like fun
and did you ever get the feeling
that these are things she's said before
her steady hands may well have done
the devil's pedicure
what you waiting for?
sing another fucking

shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
shalalala

break a mirror
roll the dice
run with scissors
through a chip pan fire fight
go into business with a grizzly bear
but just don't sit down 'cause i've moved your chair

find a well-known hard man
and start a fight
wear your shell suit
on bonfire night
fill in a circular hole with a peg that's square
but just don't sit down 'cause i've moved your chair

ooh

ooh
i etched a face of a stopwatch
on the back of a raindrop
and did a swap for the sand in an hourglass

i heard an unhappy ending
it sort of sounds like you leaving
i heard the piledriver waltz
it woke me up this morning

you look like you've been for breakfast
at the heartbreak hotel
and sat in the back booth
by the pamphlets and the literature
on how to lose
your waitress was miserable
and so was your food
if you're gonna try and walk on water
make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

mystery's flashing amber
go green when you answer
but the red on the rest of the questionnaire
never changes

i heard the news that you're planning
to shoot me out of a cannon
i heard the piledriver waltz
it woke me up this morning

you look like you've been for breakfast
at the heartbreak hotel
and sat in the back booth
by the pamphlets and the literature
on how to lose
your waitress was miserable
and so was your food
if you're gonna try and walk on water
make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

oh, piledriver
ooh-ooh
advertise in imaginative ways
start your free trial today
come on in, the water's lovely
look, you could meet someone you like
during the meteor strike
it is that easy
lunar surface on a saturday night
dressed up in silver and white
with colored old grey whistle test lights

take it easy for a little while
come and stay with us
it's such an easy flight
cute new places keep on popping up
since the exodus, it's all getting gentrified
i put a taqueria on the roof
it was well-reviewed
four stars out of five
and that's unheard of

i'm mr. bridge and tunnel on the starlight express
the head of special effects in my mind's eye
okey cokey with the opposite sex
the things you try to forget
doesn't time fly?
i'm in no position to give advice
i don't want to be nice
and you know that

take it easy for a little while
come and stay with us
it's such an easy flight
cute new places keep popping up
around clavius, it's all getting gentrified
the information action ratio
is the place to go
and you will not recognize
the old headquarters

all the nights that never happened
and the days that don't exist
at the information action ratio
only time that we stop laughing
is to breathe or steal a kiss
i can get you on the list for all the clubs
i can lift you up another semitone

take it easy for a little while (take it easy for a little while)
come and stay with us
now it's such an easy flight
cute new places keep on popping up (cute new places keep on popping up)
since the exodus, it's all getting gentrified
the information action ratio (the information action ratio)
is the place to go
four stars out of five
i put a taqueria on the moon (the information action ratio)
rave reviews
four stars out of five

take it easy for a little while (take it easy for a little while)
come and stay with us
four stars out of five
take it easy for a little while (take it easy for a little while)
come and stay with us
four stars out of five

take it easy for a little while
four stars out of five

up rolls a riot van
and sparks excitement in the boys
but the policemen look annoyed
perhaps these are ones they should avoid

got a chase last night
from men with truncheons dressed in hats
we didn't do that much wrong
still ran away though, for the laugh
just for the laugh
and please just stop talking
'cause they won't find us if you do
oh, those silly boys in blue
well, they won't catch me and you

"have you been drinking, son?
you don't look old enough to me"
"i'm sorry, officer
is there a certain age you're supposed to be?
'cause nobody told me"
and up rolls the riot van
and these lads just wind the coppers up
they ask why they don't catch proper crooks
they get their address and their names took
but they couldn't care less

thrown in the riot van
and all the coppers kicked him in
and there was no way he could win
just had to take it on the chin
it's gotta be now, innit? now, now

you got the lights on in the afternoon
and the nights are drawn out long
and you're kissing to cut through the gloom
with a cough drop colored tongue
and you were sitting in the corner with the coats all piled high
when i thought you might be mine
in a small world on an exceptionally rainy tuesday night
in the right place and time

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks

well you cured my january blues
yeah, you made it all alright
i've got a feeling i might have lit the very fuse
that we were trying not to light
and you were a stranger in my phonebook i was acting like i knew
'cause i had nothing to lose
when the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't coming true
ain't it funny what you'll do

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks

the late afternoon
the ghost in your room that you always thought didn't approve of you knocking boots
never stopped you letting me get hold of the sweet spot by the scruff of your
(knee socks)

you and me could have been a team
each had a half of a king and queen seat
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby
you and me could have been a team
each had a half of a king and queen seat
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby

you and me could have been a team (all the zeros lined up)
each had a half of a king and queen seat
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby (but the number was blocked)
you and me could have been a team
each had a half of a king and queen seat (when you've come undone)
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock (all the zeros lined up)
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste 
and your knee socks

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock (all the zeros lined up, oh)
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks

huh, huh, huh
(she looks like fun)
(she looks like fun)
(she looks like fun)
(she looks like)

smile like you've got a straw in something tropical
i've got the party plugged right into my skull
wayne manor, what a memorable n.y.e

(she looks like fun) good morning
(she looks like fun) cheeseburger
(she looks like fun) snowboarding
(she looks like)

finally, there's a place with you through cloudy skies
every whimsical thought that enters my mind
look, there ain't no limit to the length of the dickheads we can be

(she looks like fun) bukowski
(she looks like fun) dogsitting
(she looks like fun) screwballing
(she looks like)

finally, there's a place where you can wag your tongue
baby, but why can't we all just get along?
dance as if somebody's watching, 'cause they are

no one's on the streets
they've moved it all online
as of march
i'm so full of shite
i need to spend less time stood around in bars
waffling on to strangers all about martial arts
and how much i respect them

(she looks like fun) key changes
(she looks like fun) re-thinking
(she looks like fun) new order
(she looks like fun)
well, oh, they might wear classic reeboks
or knackered converse
or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
but all of that's what the point is not
the point's that there ain't no romance around there

and there's the truth that they can't see
they'd probably like to throw a punch at me
and if you could only see 'em, then you would agree
agree that there ain't no romance around there

you know, oh, it's a funny thing you know
we'll tell 'em if you like
we'll tell 'em all tonight
they'll never listen
because their minds are made up
and course it's all okay to carry on that way

'cause over there, there's broken bones
there's only music, so that there's new ringtones
and it don't take no sherlock holmes
to see it's a little different around here

don't get me wrong, though, there's boys in bands
and kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
and just 'cause he's had a couple o' cans
he thinks it's all right to act like a dickhead

don't you know, oh' it's a funny thing you know
we'll tell 'em if you like
we'll tell 'em all tonight
they'll never listen
because their minds are made up
and course it's all okay to carry on that way

but i said no
oh no
well, you won't get me to go
not anywhere, not anywhere
no, i won't go
oh no no

well, over there, there's friends of mine
what can i say? i've known 'em for a long long time
and, yeah, they might overstep the line
but you just cannot get angry in the same way
no, not in the same way
said, not in the same way
oh no, oh no no
stop making the eyes at me
i'll stop making the eyes at you
what it is that surprises me
is that i don't really want you to

and your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
your name isn't rio, but i don't care for sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
well, from 1984

i wish you'd stop ignoring me
because you're sending me to despair
without a sound, yeah, you're calling me
and i don't think it's very fair

that your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
your name isn't rio, but i don't care for sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
well, from 1984

oh, there ain't no love, no montagues or capulets
just banging tunes and dj sets and
dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness

well, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
said, from 1984
well, this is a good idea
he wouldn't do it if it wasn't
he wouldn't do it if it wasn't one
well, my friend fancies you
oh, what a way to begin it all
you said, "they're always exciting words to hear"
and they woke up together not quite realizing how
awkwardly stretching and yawning
it's always hard in the morning

and i suppose that's the price you pay
well, oh, it isn't what it was
she's thinking he looks different today
and now there's nothing left to guess now

they left before the lights came on
because they didn't want to ruin what it was that was brewing
before they absolutely had to
and how can you wake up with someone you don't love
and not feel slightly fazed by it?
oh, he had a struggle
and they woke up together not quite realizing how

awkwardly stretching and yawning
it's always hard in the morning

and i suppose that's the price you pay
well, oh, it isn't what it was
she's thinking he looks different today
and now there's nothing left to guess now

well, quick, let's leave before the lights come on
'cause then you don't have to see
'cause then you don't have to see what you've done
well, quick, let's leave before the lights come on
'cause then you don't have to see
'cause then you don't have to see what you've done

i'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
i'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
i'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
i'll walk you up
i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side
with your hands between your thighs

stop and wait a sec
when you look at me like that, my darlin', what did you expect?
i'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
or i did last time i checked

not shy of a spark
the knife twists at the thought that i should fall short of the mark
frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark
the middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side
with your hands between your thighs

but i crumble completely when you cry
it seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
i'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
take my hands off of your eyes too soon

i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side
with your hands between your thighs and a smile
007 and brucey wayne
are shitting there 'selves because there's another name coming to claim
what is his to claim
10% faster with a sturdier frame

he's certainly come into his own
there's one on his arm in every land that he roams
and two consecutive nights alone
are a thing of the past as he has recently shown

they said he looks so handsome stood not dancing
drawing you in like it's boring to him
it's a war you can't win and the first and the last are two things you'll never
be my darling

another roll around and another push and shove
further away from the idea of love
and his conclusion it must be good
oh wouldn't the penny would drop with an incredible thud
they forgot to kick the tin, he knows where she's going
but don't know where she's been
and as opposed to the other thing
he'll worry about it when it's trouble he's in

they said he looks so handsome stood not dancing
drawing you in like it's boring to him
it's a war you can't win and the first and the last are two
things you'll never be my darling

things you'll never be my darling

(two things you will never be my darling)

(two things you'll never be my darling)

well they sneered and sniffed and spat at my chat up lines
not to feel like a twat at times is hard
(but not for this kid, not when they come to you)
well, last night these two bouncers
and one of 'em's alright, the other one's the scary one
his way or no way, totalitarian
he's got no time for your looking or breathing
how he don't want you to, so step out the queue
he makes examples of you and there's nowt you can say
behind they go through to the bit where you pay
and you realize then that it's finally the time
to walk back past ten-thousand eyes in the line
and you can swap jumpers and make another move
instilled in your brain, you've got something to prove
to all the smirking faces and the boys in black
why can't they be pleasant? why can't they have a laugh?
he's got his hand in your chest, he wants to give you a duff
well, secretly i think they want you all to kick off
they want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well
it's just something to talk about, a story to tell, yeah

well, i'm so glad they turned us all away
we'll put it down to fate
i said a thousand million things
that i could never say this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

well, this town's a different town today
said, this town's a different town to what it was last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday
and that girl's a different girl today
said, that girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday
of course not

well, i'm so glad they turned us all away
we'll put it down to fate
i thought a thousand million things
that i could never think this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

last night, what we talked about
it made so much sense
but now the haze has ascended
it don't make no sense anymore
said, last night, what we talked about
it made so much sense
but now the haze has ascended
it don't make no sense anymore, oh

da-da, da-da-da
da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah, regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen
the lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
of course it's fancy dress
and they're all looking quite forlorn in bunny ears and devil horns and how

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah, regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen

i wanna see you take the jackpot out the fruit machine
and put it all back in
you've got to understand that you can never beat the bandit, no

and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
when she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
and there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
and all that is said is that you've drank a lot

and you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind, yeah
you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind

and you can pour your heart out
for a reason it would block
oh, you send her after nine o'clock

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love

and all that is said is that you've drank a lot

and you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind, yeah
you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind

and you can pour your heart out
around three o'clock
when the two-for-ones have done the writer's block
you used to get it in your fishnets
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
landed in a very common crisis
everything's in order in a black hole
nothing seems as pretty as the past though
that bloody mary's lacking in tabasco
remember when he used to be a rascal?

oh, the boy's a slag
the best you ever had
the best you ever had
is just a memory and those dreams
weren't as daft as they seem
not as daft as they seemed
my love, when you dream them up

flicking through a little book of sex tips
remember when the boys were all electric?
now, when she tells she's gonna get it
i'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
clinging to not getting sentimental
said, she wasn't going, but she went, still
likes her gentlemen to not be gentle
was it a mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

oh, the boy's a slag
the best you ever had
the best you ever had
is just a memory and those dreams
weren't as daft as they seem
not as daft as they seemed
my love, when you dream them up
oh, flo, where did you go?
where did you go?
where did you go? oh oh

you're falling about
you took a left off last laugh lane
just soundin' it out
but you're not coming back again

you're falling about
you took a left off last laugh lane
you were just soundin' it out
but you're not coming back again

you used to get it in your fishnets (falling about)
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness (you took a left off last laugh lane)
landed in a very common crisis
everything's in order in a black hole (were sounding it out)
is everything as pretty as the past though?
that bloody mary's lacking in tabasco (you're not coming back again)
remember when he used to be a rascal? oh



well, the morning was complete
where there was tears on the steering wheel, dripping on the seat
several hours or several weeks
i'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak

it's the beginning of the end 
the car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend
ask anyone, they'll tell you
that it's these times that it tends
to start to break in half, to start to fall apart
hold on to your heart

and do me a favor and break my nose
or do me a favor and tell me to go away
or do me a favor and stop asking questions

well, she walked away while her shoes were untied 
when the eyes were all red
you could see that we'd cried 
and i watched, and i waited 'til she was inside
forcing a smile and waving goodbye

curiosity becomes a heavy load
too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
curiosity becomes a heavy load
too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold

and do me a favor, and ask, if you need some help
she said, do me a favor, and stop flattering yourself
and to tear apart the ties that bind
perhaps "f*ck off" might be too kind
perhaps "f*ck off" might be too kind
this house is a circus, berserk as f*ck
we tend to see that as a perk, though look 
what it's done to your friends
their memories are pretend
and the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
this house is a circus, berserk as f*ck
we tend to see that as a perk, though look
what it's done to your friends
their memories are pretend
and the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end

there's a room full of trouble and there's lovers to be had
those ones who make sinners out of such lovely lads
scaling the corridors for maidens in the maze
and any anomaly is slipping into familiar ways
and we're forever unfulfilled and can't think why
like a search for murder clues in dead man's eyes
forever unfulfilled and can't think why
like a search for murder clues in dead man's eyes

the more you open your mouth, the more you're forcing performance
and all the attention is leading me to feel important
(gimme obnoxious, gimme obnoxious now)
now that we're here, we may as well go too far

wriggling around in incidents you won't forget
there's certainly some venom in the looks that you collect
aimlessly gazing at the faces in the queue
and we're struggling with the notion that it's life, not film

this house is a circus, berserk as f*ck (we're forever unfulfilled)
we tend to see that as a perk, though look (can't think why)
what it's done to your friends
their memories are pretend (like a search for murder clues)
and the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
just when things are getting complicated
in the eye of the storm
she flicks a red-hot revelation
off the tip of her tongue
it does a dozen somersaults
and leaves you supercharged
makes me wanna blow the candles out
just to see if you glow in the dark

shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
shalalala

home sweet home, home sweet home
home sweet booby trap
i took the batteries out my mysticism
and put them in my thinking cap
she's got a telescopic hallelujah
hanging up on the wall
for when it gets too complicated
in the eye of the storm

shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
ah

and in a hellcat spangled cavern
when your judgment's on the run
and you're acting like a stranger
'cause you thought it looked like fun
and did you ever get the feeling
that these are things she's said before
her steady hands may well have done
the devil's pedicure
what you waiting for?
sing another fucking

shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
oh baby, i'm wanting to do you a swap
i'll give you anything, yeah
in return for the noises you've got
and i can see you want to be attended to
just count to twenty-nine and i'll attend to you
oh for sure, well certainly, yeah yeah yeah

wavin' bye to the train or the bus
i'm ever so worried because
i don't want to get all forgotten

so very comfortable
don't really need to put up my feet
and even in fat sam's grand slam
can't see it being easier to speak
when you've karate-kicked your way to someone new
and i'm a memory and don't know what to do
all on his own
collecting his dole n' stuff

wavin' bye to the train or the bus
i'm ever so worried because
i don't want to get all forgotten
'cause we know
yeah, we know-oh-oh-oh
oh we know, a whoa-oh-oh

don't know where we're going, baby
i s'pose it depends
but even if we're all far apart
we can all come back and all be fine
we'll be able to be together again

be together again
be together again
be together again

everybody will be together again

black as a beacon
in a river of shimmering fog
yes she was

if you were heat-seeking
she was hard to ignore
yes she was

and she snapped
wing mirrors off of cadillacs
the particularly pretty ones

and that
meant she never had to strain her back
when she was putting her lippy on

well, time tastes bland
when she's not around
and you'd sit and you'd sink and approach the brink
before she showed you how to shake love's steady hand
that knows

and she snapped
wing mirrors off of cadillacs
the particularly pretty ones

and that
meant she never had to strain her back
when she was putting her lippy on

shake love's steady hand
shake love's steady
she floats like a niccy rush but she stings like a b-flat
the blond-o-sonic shimmer trap

and she snapped
wing mirrors off of cadillacs
the particularly pretty ones

and that
meant she never had to strain her back
when she was putting her lippy on
don't get emotional, that ain't like you
yesterday's still leaking through the roof
that's nothing new
i know i promised this is what i wouldn't do
somehow giving it the old romantic fool
seems to better suit the mood

so if you wanna walk me to the car
you oughta know i'll have a heavy heart
so can we please be absolutely sure
that there's a mirrorball?

you're getting cynical and that won't do
i'd throw the rose tint back on the exploded view
darling, if i were you
and how's that insatiable appetite?
for the moment when you look them in the eyes
and say, "baby, it's been nice"

so do you wanna walk me to the car?
i'm sure to have a heavy heart
so can we please be absolutely sure
that there's a mirrorball for me?
la, ohh
oh, there'd better be a mirrorball for me
i so wanted it long but she cut it short
and now i'm catching a cold
i told you not but no crack in the doobie
but it was already rolled

oh, i turned...
get out the way, mister
with your short sharp tips
no, i won't read your lips right now
and baby, hey
you send a shiver down my spine
but do you read ...
we all want someone to shout for
yeah, everyone wants somebody to adore
but your heroes aren't what they seem
when you've been where we've been

have ...
have you got color in your cheeks?
do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
that sticks around like summat in your teeth?
are there some aces up your sleeve?
have you no idea that you're in deep?
i've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
how many secrets can you keep?
'cause there's this tune i found
that makes me think of you somehow and i play it on repeat
until i fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

(do i wanna know?) if this feelin' flows both ways?
(sad to see you go) was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(baby, we both know) that the nights were mainly made
for sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

crawlin' back to you
ever thought of callin' when
you've had a few?
'cause i always do
maybe i'm too
busy bein' yours
to fall for somebody new
now, i've thought it through
crawlin' back to you

so have you got the guts?
been wonderin' if your heart's still open
and if so, i wanna know what time it shuts
simmer down an' pucker up, i'm sorry to interrupt
it's just i'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
i don't know if you feel the same as i do
but we could be together if you wanted to

(do i wanna know?) if this feelin' flows both ways?
(sad to see you go) was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(baby, we both know) that the nights were mainly made
for sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

crawlin' back to you (crawlin' back to you)
ever thought of callin' when
you've had a few? (had a few)
'cause i always do ('cause i always do)
maybe i'm too (maybe i'm too busy)
busy bein' yours (bein' yours)
to fall for somebody new
now, i've thought it through
crawlin' back to you

(do i wanna know?) if this feelin' flows both ways?
(sad to see you go) was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(baby, we both know) that the nights were mainly made
for sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
(do i wanna know?) too busy bein' yours to fall
(sad to see you go) ever thought of callin', darlin'?
(do i wanna know?) do you want me crawlin' back to you?
arabella's got some interstellar-gator skin boots
and a helter skelter 'round her little finger and i ride it endlessly
she's got a barbarella silver swimsuit
and when she needs to shelter from reality she takes a dip in my daydreams

my days end best when this sunset gets itself
behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side
it's much less picturesque without her catching the light
the horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

as arabella
as arabella
just might have tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure

arabella's got a seventies head
but she's a modern lover
it's an exploration, she's made of outer space
and her lips are like the galaxy's edge
and her kiss the colour of a constellation falling into place

my days end best when this sunset gets itself
behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side
it's much less picturesque without her catching the light
the horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

as arabella
as arabella
just might have tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure

that's magic in a cheetah print coat
just a slip underneath it i hope
asking if i can have one of those
organic cigarettes that she smokes
wraps her lips round the mexican coke
makes you wish that you were the bottle
takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like…

just might have tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure

it's gotta be now, innit? now, now

you got the lights on in the afternoon
and the nights are drawn out long
and you're kissing to cut through the gloom
with a cough drop colored tongue
and you were sitting in the corner with the coats all piled high
when i thought you might be mine
in a small world on an exceptionally rainy tuesday night
in the right place and time

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks

well you cured my january blues
yeah, you made it all alright
i've got a feeling i might have lit the very fuse
that we were trying not to light
and you were a stranger in my phonebook i was acting like i knew
'cause i had nothing to lose
when the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't coming true
ain't it funny what you'll do

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks

the late afternoon
the ghost in your room that you always thought didn't approve of you knocking boots
never stopped you letting me get hold of the sweet spot by the scruff of your
(knee socks)

you and me could have been a team
each had a half of a king and queen seat
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby
you and me could have been a team
each had a half of a king and queen seat
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby

you and me could have been a team (all the zeros lined up)
each had a half of a king and queen seat
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby (but the number was blocked)
you and me could have been a team
each had a half of a king and queen seat (when you've come undone)
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock (all the zeros lined up)
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste 
and your knee socks

when the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock (all the zeros lined up, oh)
when you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearing my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks

huh, huh, huh
they've sped up to the point where they provoke
the punchline before they have told the joke
plenty of desperation to be seen
staring at the television screen
they've sped up to the point where they provoke
you to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke
well sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
it wasn't in the top 100 list

and it's the thousandth time that's it's even bolder
don't be surprised when you get bent over
they told ya, but you were dying for it

saw it and she grabbed it, and it wasn't what it seemed
the kids all dream of making it, whatever that means
another variation on a theme
a tangle on the television and the magazine
do you reckon that they do it for a joke?
do you reckon that they make 'em take an oath
that says that we are defenders
of any poseur or professional pretender around

when did your list replace the twist and turn
like a fist replaced the kiss?
don't concern us with your bollocks, i don't want your prayer
save it for the morning after

and it's the thousandth time that's it's even bolder
don't be surprised when you get bent over
they told ya, but you were gagging for it

let's have a game on the teddy picker
not quick enough, can i have it quicker?
already thick and you're getting thicker
let's have a game on the teddy picker
not quick enough, can i have it quicker?
already thick and you're getting thicker

presuming that all things are equal
who'd want to be men of the people
when there's people like you?
i was biting the time zone
and we embellished the banks of our bloodstreams
and threw caution to the colorful 
then we fell asleep in the car
until the bumps woke me up in your grip 
and the tide took me to your mouth
and then swept me back down to your palms 

it's them that put me inside the reminder 
that yours is the only ocean (yours is the only ocean) 
that i wanna swing from
yours is the only ocean
that i wanna hang on 

i've got this ego mechanic
she's always trying to give me vitamins 
ah, she'd be frightened of your reflection
i preferred her as a cartoon 

if i could be someone else for a week
i'd spend it chasing after you
'cause she's not shattering my attitude
no matter how she folds the potion 

yours is the only ocean (yours is the only ocean)
that i wanna swing from
yours is the only ocean
that i want to hang on to 

(i'm swinging on)

yours is the only ocean
yours is the only ocean
yours is the only ocean
yours is the only ocean 

potion approaching, shield your eyes
potion approaching, visualize
holding a token, swollen in size
potion approaching, shield your eyes 

oh, but if we're gonna escape though
we really ought to think it through
would you like me to build you a go-kart?

there's always somebody taller with more of a wit 
and he's equipped to enthrall her and her friends think he's fit
and you just can't measure up though, you don't have a prayer
wishing that you'd made the most of her when she was there 

they've got engaged, there's no intention of a wedding 
he's pinched your bird and he'd probably kick your head in 

bigger boys and stolen sweethearts 
oh, you're better off without her anyway 
you said you wasn't sad to see her go 
yeah, but i know you were though

now you don't know what she's up to, you can only assume
if she's not in the front of the shops then they've gone to his room
bet she's gone 'round in her school stuff, bet that's what he likes
i know you thought she were different and you thought she were nice

but she's not nice, she's pretty fucking far from nice
she's looking at you funny rarely looking at you twice

bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
oh, you're better off without her anyway
you said you wasn't sad to see her go
yeah, but it's so clear you were though 

have you heard what she's been doing? never did it for me 
he picks her up at the school gates at twenty past three 
she's been with all of the boys but never went very far 
and she wagged english and science just to go in his car 

they've got engaged, there's no intention of a wedding 
he's pinched my bird and he'd probably kick my head in 
oh, now the girls have grown 
yeah, but i'm sure that they still carry on in similar ways 

bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
oh, you're better off without her anyway
you said you wasn't sad to see her go
yeah, but i'm only pretending, you know 
yeah, i'm only pretending, you know 
i was only pretending, you know 
i was only pretending, you know
well, oh, they might wear classic reeboks
or knackered converse
or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
but all of that's what the point is not
the point's that there ain't no romance around there

and there's the truth that they can't see
they'd probably like to throw a punch at me
and if you could only see 'em, then you would agree
agree that there ain't no romance around there

you know, oh, it's a funny thing you know
we'll tell 'em if you like
we'll tell 'em all tonight
they'll never listen
because their minds are made up
and course it's all okay to carry on that way

'cause over there, there's broken bones
there's only music, so that there's new ringtones
and it don't take no sherlock holmes
to see it's a little different around here

don't get me wrong, though, there's boys in bands
and kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
and just 'cause he's had a couple o' cans
he thinks it's all right to act like a dickhead

don't you know, oh' it's a funny thing you know
we'll tell 'em if you like
we'll tell 'em all tonight
they'll never listen
because their minds are made up
and course it's all okay to carry on that way

but i said no
oh no
well, you won't get me to go
not anywhere, not anywhere
no, i won't go
oh no no

well, over there, there's friends of mine
what can i say? i've known 'em for a long long time
and, yeah, they might overstep the line
but you just cannot get angry in the same way
no, not in the same way
said, not in the same way
oh no, oh no no

if you were there, beware the serpent soul pinchers
three-hundred and fifty "no, thank you"s and nobody flinches
go on, girl, go on, give us something gruesome
we require your grief, the thugs help the thieves
as they're trying to rob the words from her gob and
take the source of the innocence

if you were there, beware the serpent soul pinchers
can't you sense she was never meant to fill column inches
ain't you had enough? what you're trying to dig up
isn't there to be dug, the thieves help the thugs
as they're trying to beat the good grace of a sweetheart
out to the point she'll comply

and why leave her on her own?
if i'd have known then i wouldn't have said it
i wouldn't have said it if i would have known
why leave her on her own?
if i predicted tears then i wouldn't have said it
i wouldn't have said it if i would have known

there's a circle of witches, ambitiously vicious they are
our attempts to remind them of reason won't get us that far
but i don't know what it is that they want
i don't know what it is that they want
but i haven't got it to give
and she hasn't got it to give
well, now then, mardy bum
i've seen your frown and it's like looking down
the barrel of a gun
and it goes off
and out come all these words
oh, there's a very pleasant side to you
a side i much prefer

it's one that laughs and jokes around
remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
to get things off the ground
and it was up, up and away
oh, but it's right hard to remember that
on a day like today
when you're all argumentative
and you've got the face on

well, now then, mardy bum
oh, i'm in trouble again, aren't i?
i thought as much
'cause you turned over there
pulling that silent disappointment face
the one that i can't bare

well, can't we just laugh and joke around?
remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
to get things off the ground
and it was up, up and away
oh, but it's right hard to remember that
on a day like today
when you're all argumentative
and you've got the face on

and, yeah, i'm sorry i was late
but i missed the train
and then the traffic was a state
and i can't be arsed to carry on in this debate
that reoccurs, oh, when you say i don't care
but, of course i do, yeah, i clearly do

so laugh and joke around?
remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
to get things off the ground
and it was up, up and away
oh, but it's right hard to remember that
on a day like today
when you're all argumentative
and you've got the face on
darlin' tell me something i don't know
be my baby, be my gto
call me something no one else calls me
i forget how i want it
that electricity

my heart was breaking and got left unlocked
didn't see you sneak in but i'm glad you stopped
tell me something i don't already know
like how you get your kisses to fill me with electricity

love like locked horns
love like dominos
be my midnight
be my ebb and flow
i forget how i want it
how it crept up on me
it takes over
electricity

and my heart was breaking and got left unlocked
didn't see you sneak in but i'm glad you stopped
tell me something i don't already know
like how you get your kisses to fill me with electricity

separated
there i face it
love like thunder
love like falling snow

tell me something i don't already know
like how you get your kisses to fill me with electricity
get on your dancing shoes
there's one thing on your mind
hoping they're looking for you
sure you'll be rummaging through

oh and the shit, shock, the horror
you've seen your future bride
yeah, but it's oh so absurd
for you to say the first word
so you're waiting and waiting and

the only reason that you came
so what you scared for
oh, don't you always do the same
it's what you there for, don't you know

the lights are flashing
down in here tonight
and some might exchange a glance
but keep pretending to dance

don't act like it's not happening
as if it's impolite
to go and mention your name
instead you'll just do the same
as they all do, and hope for the best

the only reason that you came
so what you scared for
well don't you always do the same
it's what you're there for but no

get on your dancing shoes
you sexy little swine
hoping they're looking for you
sure you'll be rummaging through

and i said the shit, shock, horror
you've seen your future bride, yeah
yeah, but it's oh so absurd
for you to say the first word
so you're waiting and waiting

he sank into their calculations
and snorted on the stench
of their arithmetic
looked for the boy who was hanging his head low
more trophies than ideas, to follow their pretense

with a scowl in his pocket and a smile on his face
he followed with obedience
and fell in the nettles

afterwards those spikey whispers said he bought his own rope
and skipped the bits they loathed
didn't scramble to find a dock leaf to capture back our hope
to advice his mind had closed
he lost all of his footholes

and with a scowl in his pocket and a smile on his face
he followed with obedience
and fell in the nettles, fell in the nettles, fell in the nettles

he was a toothpick!
and the garlic and the cinder upon the path
had failed to blunt or hinder the slow collapse
clinging to the doorframe he was dragged
off to a reminder of where he had been

with a smile in his pocket
and a scowl on his face
he had nowhere to flee
so sat content in the nettles
i saw you dancin'
you moved like sinatra
on speed

the lights were a-flashin'
and tongues were a-waggin'
over you
it's too late for tryin'
it's too late for denyin'
all those little things
you and me have done
i'm sorry, hon'
i was hopin' for a recall
a mix of you high from the sun
oh, but nothin'
only lone magpies come

i saw you dancin'
you moved like sinatra
on speed
well, this is a good idea
he wouldn't do it if it wasn't
he wouldn't do it if it wasn't one

well, my friend fancies you
oh, what a way to begin it all
you said they're always exciting words to hear

they woke up together
not quite realizing how
awkwardly stretching and yawning
it's always hard in the morning

and i suppose that's the price you pay
well, oh, it isn't what it was
she's thinking he looks different today
and oh, there's nothing left to guess now

they left before the lights came on
because they didn't want to ruin
what it was that was brewing
before they absolutely had to

and how can you wake up
with someone you don't love?
and not feel slightly phased by it
oh, he had a struggle

they woke up together
not quite realizing how
awkwardly stretching and yawning
it's always hard in the morning

and i suppose that's the price you pay
well, oh, it isn't what it was
she's thinking he looks different today
and oh, there's nothing left to guess now

quick, let's leave
before the lights come on
'cause then you don't have to see
'cause then you don't have to see what you've done

quick, let's leave
before the lights come on
'cause then you don't have to see
'cause then you don't have to see what you've done

i'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
i'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
i'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
well, it's ever so funny
'cause i don't think you're special, i don't think you're cool
you're just probably alright
but under these lights you look beautiful
and i'm struggling, i can't see through your fake tan
yeah, and you know it for a fact that everybody's eating out of your hands

but what do you know?
oh, you know nothing
yeah, but i'll still take you home
oh, yeah, i'll still take you home
so what do you know?
said, you don't know nothing

well, fancy seeing you in here
you're all tarted up and you don't look the same
well, i haven't seen you since last year
yeah, and surprisingly you have forgotten my name
but you know it, yeah, and you knew it all along
oh and you say you have forgotten
but you're fibbing, go on, tell me i'm wrong

so what do you know?
oh, you know nothing
yeah, but i'll still take you home
oh, yeah, i'll still take you home
so what do you know?
oh, you don't know nothing, no

oh-woah, woah, woah
oh-woah, woah, woah
da-da, da-da-da, da-da, da-da
da-da, da-da, da-da-da
oh-woah, woah, woah

oh, so what do you know?
yeah, you don't know nothing, no
yeah, but i'd still take you home
oh, yeah, i'll still take you home
i said, what do you know?
oh, you don't know nothing

i fancy you with a passion
oh, you're a topshop princess, a rockstar, too
but you're a fad and you're a fashion
and i'm having a job trying to talk to you
but it's alright, yeah, i'll put it on one side
oh, 'cause everybody's looking, you've got control of everyone's eyes
including mine
just another microcosm somewhere in the ether
putting a world to rights with bing crosby eyes
oversharing and its bitter aftertaste
exactly the wrong time in exactly the wrong place
save it for a rainy day
baby, you go hard in the paint
it's just another race to anyways

philanthropic toga party
what a place for both the
opposite sides of my double life to finally collide
sharing secrets i was taking to the grave
nosebleeds from epiphanies i took full in the face
oh, come all by the fire, babe, let's all participate
in yet another race to anyways
oh, how's your mum and dad been doing with the generation gap?

yeah, i'm behind my movie camera
i've got my megaphone
you can call me alexander
it's nice to meet you all

listening to the shipping forecast
driving to the airport
me and the guys
metropolis ablaze in the rear view
devising methods to both have and eat your cake
mmm, just like the ones that mother nature used to bake
you look as if you know exactly what i'm gonna say
is just another race to
anyways
he knew what he wanted to say
but he did not want to word it
the dirty little herbert
was seeking an escape
but the place was well-guarded
the guiltiness that started
soon as the other part had stopped

d is for delightful
and try and keep your trousers on
i think you should know you're his favorite worst nightmare

d is for desperately trying to simulate
what it was that was all right
three quarters of an hour ago
that had led him to be in a position
on every compromission
and every other episode

he's nearing the brink, but he thinks first
the parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene

the parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
he's nearing the brink, but he thinks first

arabella's got some interstellar gator-skin boots
and a helter skelter 'round her little finger and i ride it endlessly
she's got a barbarella silver swimsuit
and when she needs to shelter from reality she takes a dip in my daydreams

my days end best when the sunset gets itself
behind that little lady sittin' on the passenger side
it's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
the horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

as arabella, oh
arabella
just might've tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure

arabella's got a seventies head
but she's a modern lover, it's an exploration, she's made of outer space
and her lips are like the galaxy's edge
and her kiss the color of a constellation fallin' into place

my days end best when the sunset gets itself
behind that little lady sittin' on the passenger side
it's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
the horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

as arabella, oh
as arabella
just might've tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure

that's magic in a cheetah-print coat
just a slip underneath it i hope
askin' if i can have one of those
organic cigarettes that she smokes
wraps her lips 'round a mexican coke
makes you wish that you were the bottle
takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like
woo!

i just might've tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure

i'd like to play for you now, ladies and gentleman 
the uh, title track from our new lp
entitled, "tranquility base hotel and casino", get down
anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah, regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen
the lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
of course it's fancy dress
and they're all looking quite forlorn in bunny ears and devil horns and how

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah, regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen

i wanna see you take the jackpot out the fruit machine
and put it all back in
you've got to understand that you can never beat the bandit, no

and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
when she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
and there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
and all that is said is that you've drank a lot

and you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind, yeah
you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind

and you can pour your heart out
for a reason it would block
oh, you send her after nine o'clock

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah, regardless of what's gone before

and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
when she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
and there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
and all that is said is that you've drank a lot

and you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind, yeah
you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind

and you can pour your heart out
around three o'clock
when the two-for-ones have done the writer's block
you've never met before
but still she greets you like a long lost rock and roll
she's definitely one of those
where you go wherever she goes

oh my body and my mind
both start talking at the exact same time
try'na think of ways to make her mine
but they're difficult to find

it's not what i need
no, your love's not what i need
so don't give it to me

and she said: 'oh, well i knew this will sound cold
but i really have to go
oh it's not that i'm not free
there's nowhere i need to be
it's just your love's not what i need
so don't give it to me'

it's not what i need
no, your love's not what i need
so don't give it to me

she said: i baby i can never leave you
how can i believe you when you can't believe your luck
no point sticking to the plan when it's going slow

it's more a hunger than a thirst
you'll break it out the second time
before you know about the first
looks well-equipped to leave you in the lurch
but you'll let her do her worst

and it's not hard to tell
it's obvious the other angels faces fell
when she told them that she had to go
traded her wings and overcoat for something colorful

(tha knows)

well, oh, they might wear classic reeboks
or knackered converse
or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
but all of that's what the point is not
the point's that there ain't no romance around there

and there's the truth that they can't see
they'd probably like to throw a punch at me
and if you could only see 'em, then you would agree
agree that there ain't no romance around there

we'll tell 'em if you like
we'll tell 'em all tonight
they'll never listen
because their minds are made up
and course it's all okay to carry on that way

'cause over there, there's broken bones
there's only music, so that there's new ringtones
and it don't take no sherlock holmes
to see it's a little different around here

don't get me wrong, though, there's boys in bands
and kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
and just 'cause he's had a couple o' cans
he thinks it's all right to act like a dickhead

don't you know, oh' it's a funny thing you know
we'll tell 'em if you like

but i said no
oh no
well, you won't get me to go
not anywhere, not anywhere
no, i won't go
oh no no

well, over there, there's friends of mine
what can i say? i've known 'em for a long long time
and, yeah, they might overstep the line
but you just cannot get angry in the same way
no, not in the same way
said, not in the same way
oh no, oh no no

well, last night these two bouncers
and one of 'em's alright, the other one's the scary one
his way or no way, totalitarian
he's got no time for your looking or breathing
how he don't want you to, so step out the queue
he makes examples of you and there's nowt you can say
behind they go through to the bit where you pay
and you realize then that it's finally the time
to walk back past ten-thousand eyes in the line
and you can swap jumpers and make another move
instilled in your brain, you've got something to prove
to all the smirking faces and the boys in black
why can't they be pleasant? why can't they have a laugh?
he's got his hand in your chest, he wants to give you a duff
well, secretly i think they want you all to kick off
they want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well
it's just something to talk about, a story to tell, yeah

well, i'm so glad they turned us all away
we'll put it down to fate
i said a thousand million things
that i could never say this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

well, this town's a different town today
said, this town's a different town to what it was last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday
and that girl's a different girl today
said, that girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday
of course not

well, i'm so glad they turned us all away
we'll put it down to fate
i thought a thousand million things
that i could never think this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

last night, what we talked about
it made so much sense
but now the haze has ascended
it don't make no sense anymore
said, last night, what we talked about
it made so much sense
but now the haze has ascended
it don't make no sense anymore, oh

da-da, da-da-da
da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
he looks as if he hasn't slept
his hair is purposely unkept
and then he know his people wept
when you crafted your plan

shadows underneath the eyes
and everywhere the bastard lies
my lack of proof is your disguise
you won't remember me

there's nothing really i can say
but sorry mate and walk away
i could be wrong unless you play your game

this world is full of most unkind
and horrible is redefined
i can't imagine that you'd mind at all

you're lying again, you're conscience in your friend
and the only thing you're sorting out is your imagination
lying again, your conscience in your friend
and the only thing you're sorting out is your imagination

is he really on the street?
desperation or deceit?
and what he's wearing on his feet
won't solve our mystery

and i am baffled by
how you stand there, soaking it in
and do you hide your identity
where you hide your grin? better hide your grin

shadows underneath the eyes
everywhere the bastard lies
my lack of proof is your disguise
you won't remember me

there's nothing really i can say
but sorry mate and walk away
i could be wrong unless you play your game

this world is full of most unkind
and horrible is redefined
i can't imagine that you'd mind at all

you're lying again, your conscience in your friend
and the only thing you're sorting out is your imagination

and the only thing you're sorting out is your imagination

he knew what he wanted to say
but he did not want to word it
the dirty little herbert
was seeking an escape
but the place was well-guarded
the guiltiness that started
soon as the other part had stopped

d is for delightful
and try and keep your trousers on
i think you should know you're his favorite worst nightmare

d is for desperately trying to simulate
what it was that was all right
three quarters of an hour ago
that had led him to be in a position
on every compromission
and every other episode

he's nearing the brink, but he thinks first
the parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
he's nearing the brink, but he thinks first

get on your dancing shoes
there's one thing on your mind
hoping they're looking for you
sure you'll be rummaging through

oh and the shit, shock, the horror
you've seen your future bride
yeah, but it's oh so absurd
for you to say the first word
so you're waiting and waiting and

the only reason that you came
so what you scared for
oh, don't you always do the same
it's what you there for, don't you know

the lights are flashing
down in here tonight
and some might exchange a glance
but keep pretending to dance

don't act like it's not happening
as if it's impolite
to go and mention your name
instead you'll just do the same
as they all do, and hope for the best

the only reason that you came
so what you scared for
well don't you always do the same
it's what you're there for but no

get on your dancing shoes
you sexy little swine
hoping they're looking for you
sure you'll be rummaging through

and i said the shit, shock, horror
you've seen your future bride, yeah
yeah, but it's oh so absurd
for you to say the first word
so you're waiting and waiting
i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination you're waitin', lyin' on your side
with your hands between your thighs

stop and wait a sec
when you look at me like that, my darlin'
what did you expect?
i probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
or i did last time i checked

not shy of a spark
the knife twists at the thought that i should fall short of the mark
or frightened by the bite though it's no harsher than the bark
the middle of adventure, seem like a perfect place to start

i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination you're waitin', lyin' on your side
with your hands between your thighs

alright

but i crumble completely when you cry
it seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
i'm always just about to go and spoil the surprise
take my hands off of your eyes too soon

i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination you're waitin', lyin' on your side
with your hands between your thighs and a smile (whoa)
come and take a leaf out of my book
i'm a crack dealing crook
selling lots of rock and roll to the masses
and i know if you wanna take a trip to the city
we can go (to gibraltar)
we can go (to gibraltar)

let's go, let's go, let's go, come on
come on, come on, come on, come on
let's go, let's go, let's go, come on

give me your switch card
i'll book some flights

1996 and i'm stuck at the bottom of a truck
on the run from the mi5, got detectives
and i'll say if you catch me that i really wish
that i had stayed (in gibraltar)
that i had stayed (in gibraltar)

let's go, let's go, let's go, come on
come on, come on, come on, come on
let's go, let's go, let's go, come on

give me your switch card
i'll book some flights

said, who's that girl there? 
i wonder what went wrong
so that she had to roam the streets
she don't do major credit cards
i doubt she does receipts
it's all not quite legitimate
and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes, yeah
that he's got a driving ban
amongst some other offences

and i've seen him with girls of the night
and he told roxanne to put on her red light
they're all infected but he'll be alright
'cause he's a scumbag, don't you know?
i said, he's a scumbag, don't you know?

although you're trying not to listen
avert your eyes and staring at the ground
she makes a subtle proposition
"i'm sorry, love, i'll have to turn you down"
and oh, he must be up to summat
what are the chances? sure it's more than likely
i've got a feeling in my stomach
and start to wonder what his story might be
what his story might be, yeah

'cause they said it changes when the sun goes down
yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here, around here, oh

and look here comes a ford mondeo
isn't he mister inconspicuous?
and he don't have to say 'owt
she's in the stance ready to get picked up
bet she's delighted when she sees him
pulling in and giving her the eye
because she must be fucking freezing
scantily-clad beneath the clear night sky
and don't stop in the winter, no

and they said it changes when the sun goes down
yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here

well, they said it changes when the sun goes down
over the river, going out of town
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here, around here, oh

and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance
i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes, yeah, that he's got a nasty plan
i hope you're not involved at all
fake tales of san francisco
echo through the room
more point to a wedding disco
without a bride or groom
and there's a super cool band, yeah
with their trilbies and their glasses of white wine
and all the weekend rock stars are in the toilet
practicing their lines

i don't want to hear you
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you, no
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you
i don't want to hear your

fake tales of san francisco
echo through the air
and there's a few bored faces at the back
all wishing they weren't there

and as the microphone squeaks
a young girl's telephone beeps
yeah, she's dashing for the exit
oh, she's running to the streets outside
"oh, you've saved me," she screams down the line
"the band were fucking wank
and i'm not having a nice time"

i don't want to hear you
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you, no
(kick me out, kick me out)

yeah, but his bird said it's amazing, though
so all that's left
is the proof that love's not only blind but deaf

he talks of san francisco, he's from hunter's bar
i don't quite know the distance
but i'm sure that's far
yeah i'm sure it's pretty far

and yeah, i'd love to tell you all my problem
you're not from new york city, you're from rotherham
so get off the bandwagon, and put down the handbook
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
well, it's ever so funny
'cause i don't think you're special, i don't think you're cool
you're just probably alright
but under these lights you look beautiful
and i'm struggling, i can't see through your fake tan
yeah, and you know it for a fact that everybody's eating out of your hands

but what do you know?
oh, you know nothing
yeah, but i'll still take you home
oh, yeah, i'll still take you home
so what do you know?
said, you don't know nothing

well, fancy seeing you in here
you're all tarted up and you don't look the same
well, i haven't seen you since last year
yeah, and surprisingly you have forgotten my name
but you know it, yeah, and you knew it all along
oh and you say you have forgotten
but you're fibbing, go on, tell me i'm wrong

so what do you know?
oh, you know nothing
yeah, but i'll still take you home
oh, yeah, i'll still take you home
so what do you know?
oh, you don't know nothing, no

oh-woah, woah, woah
oh-woah, woah, woah
da-da, da-da-da, da-da, da-da
da-da, da-da, da-da-da
oh-woah, woah, woah

oh, so what do you know?
yeah, you don't know nothing, no
yeah, but i'd still take you home
oh, yeah, i'll still take you home
i said, what do you know?
oh, you don't know nothing

i fancy you with a passion
oh, you're a topshop princess, a rockstar, too
but you're a fad and you're a fashion
and i'm having a job trying to talk to you
but it's alright, yeah, i'll put it on one side
oh, 'cause everybody's looking, you've got control of everyone's eyes
including mine
this house is a circus, berserk as f*ck
we tend to see that as a perk, though look 
what it's done to your friends
their memories are pretend
and the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
this house is a circus, berserk as f*ck
we tend to see that as a perk, though look
what it's done to your friends
their memories are pretend
and the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end

there's a room full of trouble and there's lovers to be had
those ones who make sinners out of such lovely lads
scaling the corridors for maidens in the maze
and any anomaly is slipping into familiar ways
and we're forever unfulfilled and can't think why
like a search for murder clues in dead man's eyes
forever unfulfilled and can't think why
like a search for murder clues in dead man's eyes

the more you open your mouth, the more you're forcing performance
and all the attention is leading me to feel important
(gimme obnoxious, gimme obnoxious now)
now that we're here, we may as well go too far

wriggling around in incidents you won't forget
there's certainly some venom in the looks that you collect
aimlessly gazing at the faces in the queue
and we're struggling with the notion that it's life, not film

this house is a circus, berserk as f*ck (we're forever unfulfilled)

take a little walk to the edge of town and go across the tracks
where the viaduct looms like a bird of doom as it shifts and cracks
where secrets lie in the border fires in the humming wires
well, you know you're never coming back

past the square, past the bridge, past the mills, past the stacks
on a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man
in a dusty black coat with a red right hand

he'll wrap you in his arms and tell you that you've been a good boy
he'll rekindle all the dreams it took you a lifetime to destroy
he'll reach deep into the hole, heal your shrinking soul
and there won't be a single thing that you can do

he's a god, he's a man, he's a ghost, he's a guru
they're whispering his name 'cross this disappearing land
but hidden in his coat is a red right hand

you don't have no money? he'll get you some
if you haven't got no car, he'll get you one
you've got no self-respect, you feel like an insect
well, don't you worry, buddy, 'cause here he comes
through the ghettos and the barrows and the bowery and the slum
a shadow is cast wherever he stands
stacks of green paper in his red right hand

you'll see him in your nightmares, you'll see him in your dreams
he'll appear out of nowhere, but he's not what he seems
you'll see him in your head on the tv screen
hey, buddy, i'm warning you to turn it off

he's a ghost, he's a god, he's a man, he's a guru
you're one microscopic cog in his catastrophic plan
designed and directed by his red right hand

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah, regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen
the lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
of course it's fancy dress
and they're all looking quite forlorn in bunny ears and devil horns and how

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah, regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen

i wanna see you take the jackpot out the fruit machine
and put it all back in
you've got to understand that you can never beat the bandit, no

and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
when she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
and there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
and all that is said is that you've drank a lot

and you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind, yeah
you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind

and you can pour your heart out
for a reason it would block
oh, you send her after nine o'clock

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah, regardless of what's gone before

and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
when she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
and there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
and all that is said is that you've drank a lot

and you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind, yeah
you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind

and you can pour your heart out
around three o'clock
when the two-for-ones have done the writer's block




well, the morning was complete
where there was tears on the steering wheel, dripping on the seat
several hours or several weeks
i'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak

it's the beginning of the end 
the car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend
ask anyone, they'll tell you
that it's these times that it tends
to start to break in half, to start to fall apart
hold on to your heart

and do me a favor and break my nose
or do me a favor and tell me to go away
or do me a favor and stop asking questions

well, she walked away while her shoes were untied 
when the eyes were all red
you could see that we'd cried 
and i watched, and i waited 'til she was inside
forcing a smile and waving goodbye

curiosity becomes a heavy load
too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
curiosity becomes a heavy load
too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold

and do me a favor, and ask, if you need some help
she said, do me a favor, and stop flattering yourself
and to tear apart the ties that bind
perhaps "f*ck off" might be too kind
perhaps "f*ck off" might be too kind
they've sped up to the point where they provoke
the punchline before they have told the joke
plenty desperation to be seen
staring at the television screen
they've sped up to the point where they provoke
you to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke
well sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
it wasn't in the top 100 list

and it's the thousandth time that's it's even bolder
don't be surprised when you get bent over
they told ya, but you were dying for it

she saw it, and she grabbed it, and it wasn't what it seemed
the kids all dream of making it, whatever that means
another variation on a theme
a tangle on the television and the magazine
do you reckon that they do it for a joke?
do you reckon that they make 'em take an oath
that says that we are defenders
of any poseur or professional pretender around

when did your list replace the twist and turn
like a fist replaced the kiss?
don't concern us with your bollocks, i don't want your prayer
save it for the morning after

and it's the thousandth time that's it's even bolder
don't be surprised when you get bent over
they told ya, but you were dying for it

let's have a game on the teddy picker
not quick enough, can i have it quicker?
already thick and you're getting thicker
let's have a game on the teddy picker
not quick enough, can i have it quicker?
already thick and you're getting thicker

presuming that all things are equal
who'd want to be men of the people
when there's people like you?
you used to get it in your fishnets
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
landed in a very common crisis
everything's in order in a black hole
nothing seems as pretty as the past though
that bloody mary's lacking in tabasco
remember when he used to be a rascal?

oh, the boy's a slag
the best you ever had
the best you ever had
is just a memory and those dreams
weren't as daft as they seem
not as daft as they seemed
my love, when you dream them up

flicking through a little book of sex tips
remember when the boys were all electric?
now, when she tells she's gonna get it
i'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
clinging to not getting sentimental
said, she wasn't going, but she went, still
likes her gentlemen to not be gentle
was it a mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

oh, the boy's a slag
the best you ever had
the best you ever had
is just a memory and those dreams
weren't as daft as they seem
not as daft as they seemed
my love, when you dream them up
oh, flo, where did you go?
where did you go?
where did you go? oh oh

you're falling about
you took a left off last laugh lane
just soundin' it out
but you're not coming back again

you're falling about
you took a left off last laugh lane
you were just soundin' it out
but you're not coming back again

you used to get it in your fishnets (falling about)
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness (you took a left off last laugh lane)
landed in a very common crisis
everything's in order in a black hole (were sounding it out)
is everything as pretty as the past though?
that bloody mary's lacking in tabasco (you're not coming back again)
remember when he used to be a rascal? oh

have you got color in your cheeks?
do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
that sticks around like summat in your teeth?
are there some aces up your sleeve?
have you no idea that you're in deep?
i've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
how many secrets can you keep?
'cause there's this tune i found
that makes me think of you somehow and i play it on repeat
until i fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

(do i wanna know?) if this feelin' flows both ways?
(sad to see you go) was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(baby, we both know) that the nights were mainly made
for sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

crawlin' back to you
ever thought of callin' when
you've had a few?
'cause i always do
maybe i'm too
busy bein' yours
to fall for somebody new
now, i've thought it through
crawlin' back to you

so have you got the guts?
been wonderin' if your heart's still open
and if so, i wanna know what time it shuts
simmer down an' pucker up, i'm sorry to interrupt
it's just i'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
i don't know if you feel the same as i do
but we could be together if you wanted to

(do i wanna know?) if this feelin' flows both ways?
(sad to see you go) was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(baby, we both know) that the nights were mainly made
for sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

crawlin' back to you (crawlin' back to you)
ever thought of callin' when
you've had a few? (had a few)
'cause i always do ('cause i always do)
maybe i'm too (maybe i'm too busy)
busy bein' yours (bein' yours)
to fall for somebody new
now, i've thought it through
crawlin' back to you

(do i wanna know?) too busy bein' yours to fall
(sad to see you go) ever thought of callin', darlin'?
(do i wanna know?) do you want me crawlin' back to you?

your love is like a studded leather headlock
your kiss, it put could creases in the rain
you're rarer than a can of dandelion and burdock
and those other girls are just postmix lemonade

suck it and see, you never know
sit next to me before i go
jigsaw women with horror movie blue shoes
be cruel to me 'cause i'm a fool for you

i poured my aching heart into a pop song
i couldn't get the hang of poetry
that's not a skirt, girl, that's a sawn-off shotgun
and i can only hope you've got it aimed at me

suck it and see, you never know
sit next to me before i go
jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
be cruel to me 'cause i'm a fool for

blue moon girls from once upon a shangri-la
how i often wonder where you are
you have got that face that just says
"baby, i was made to break your heart", oh-oh-oh

suck it and see, you never know
sit next to me before i go, go, go, go
jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
be cruel to me 'cause i am a fool for you

he'll appear out of nowhere, but he's not what he seems
you'll see him in your head on the tv screen
hey, buddy, i'm warning you to turn it off

he's a ghost, he's a god, he's a man, he's a guru
you're one microscopic cog in his catastrophic plan
designed and directed by his red right hand

last night these two bouncers
and one of 'em's alright, the other one's the scary one
his way or no way, totalitarian
he's got no time for your looking or breathing
how he don't want you to, so step out the queue
he makes examples of you and there's nowt you can say
behind they go through to the bit where you pay
and you realize then that it's finally the time
to walk back past ten-thousand eyes in the line
and you can swap jumpers and make another move
instilled in your brain, you've got something to prove
to all the smirking faces and the boys in black
why can't they be pleasant? why can't they have a laugh?
he's got his hand in your chest, he wants to give you a duff
well, secretly i think they want you all to kick off
they want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well
it's just something to talk about, a story to tell, yeah

well, i'm so glad they turned us all away
we'll put it down to fate
i said a thousand million things
that i could never say this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

well, this town's a different town today
said, this town's a different town to what it was last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday
and that girl's a different girl today
and that girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday
of course not

well, i'm so glad they turned us all away
we'll put it down to fate
i thought a thousand million things
that i could never think this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

last night, what we talked about
it made so much sense
but now the haze has ascended
it don't make no sense anymore
last night, what we talked about
it made so much sense
but now the haze has ascended
it don't make no sense anymore, oh


brian
top marks for not trying
so kind of you to bless us
with your effortlessness
we're grateful and so strangely comforted
and i wonder
are you putting us under
'cause we can't take our eyes
off the t-shirt and ties combination?
well, see you later, innovator

some want to kiss, some want to kick you
there's not a net you couldn't slip through
or at least that's the impression i get
'cause you're smooth, and you're wet
and she's not aware yet
but she's yours
she'll be saying, "use me
show me the jacuzzi"
i imagine that it's there on a plate
your whole rendezvous rate
means that you'll never be frightened
to make them wait for a while
i doubt it's your style
not to get what you set
out to acquire, the eyes are on fire
you are the unforecasted storm

(brian) calm, collected and commanding
(top marks for not trying)
you leave the other stories standing
with your renditions and jokes
bet there's hundreds of blokes
that have wept 'cause you've stolen their

thunder
are you putting us under
'cause we can't take our eyes
off the t-shirt and ties combination?

well, see you later, innovator
fake tales of san francisco
echo through the room
more point to a wedding disco
without a bride or groom
and there's a super cool band, yeah
with their trilbies and their glasses of white wine
and all the weekend rock stars are in the toilet
practicing their lines

i don't want to hear you
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you, no
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you
i don't want to hear your

fake tales of san francisco
echo through the air
and there's a few bored faces at the back
all wishing they weren't there

and as the microphone squeaks
a young girl's telephone beeps
yeah, she's dashing for the exit
oh, she's running to the streets outside
"oh, you've saved me," she screams down the line
"the band were fucking wank
and i'm not having a nice time"

i don't want to hear you
(kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you, no
(kick me out, kick me out)

yeah, but his bird said it's amazing, though
so all that's left
is the proof that love's not only blind but deaf

he talks of san francisco, he's from hunter's bar
i don't quite know the distance
but i'm sure that's far
yeah i'm sure it's pretty far

and yeah, i'd love to tell you all my problem
you're not from new york city, you're from rotherham
so get off the bandwagon, and put down the handbook
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
you used to get it in your fishnets
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
landed in a very common crisis
everything's in order in a black hole
nothing seems as pretty as the past though
that bloody mary's lacking in tabasco
remember when he used to be a rascal?

oh, the boy's a slag
the best you ever had
the best you ever had
is just a memory and those dreams
weren't as daft as they seem
not as daft as they seemed
my love, when you dream them up

flicking through a little book of sex tips
remember when the boys were all electric?
now, when she tells she's gonna get it
i'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
clinging to not getting sentimental
said, she wasn't going, but she went, still
likes her gentlemen to not be gentle
was it a mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

oh, the boy's a slag
the best you ever had
the best you ever had
is just a memory and those dreams
weren't as daft as they seem
not as daft as they seemed
my love, when you dream them up
oh, flo, where did you go?
where did you go?
where did you go? oh oh

you're falling about
you took a left off last laugh lane
just soundin' it out
but you're not coming back again

you're falling about
you took a left off last laugh lane
you were just soundin' it out
but you're not coming back again

you used to get it in your fishnets (falling about)
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness (you took a left off last laugh lane)
landed in a very common crisis
everything's in order in a black hole (were sounding it out)
is everything as pretty as the past though?
that bloody mary's lacking in tabasco (you're not coming back again)
remember when he used to be a rascal? oh
007 and brucey wayne
are shitting there 'selves because there's another name coming to claim
what is his to claim
10% faster with a sturdier frame

he's certainly come into his own
there's one on his arm in every land that he roams
and two consecutive nights alone
are a thing of the past as he has recently shown

they said he looks so handsome stood not dancing
drawing you in like it's boring to him
it's a war you can't win and the first and the last are two things you'll never
be my darling

another roll around and another push and shove
further away from the idea of love
and his conclusion it must be good
oh wouldn't the penny would drop with an incredible thud
they forgot to kick the tin, he knows where she's going
but don't know where she's been
and as opposed to the other thing
he'll worry about it when it's trouble he's in

they said he looks so handsome stood not dancing
drawing you in like it's boring to him
it's a war you can't win and the first and the last are two
things you'll never be my darling

things you'll never be my darling

(two things you will never be my darling)

(two things you'll never be my darling)

well they sneered and sniffed and spat at my chat up lines
not to feel like a twat at times is hard
(but not for this kid, not when they come to you)
anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah, regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen
the lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
of course it's fancy dress
and they're all looking quite forlorn in bunny ears and devil horns and how

you've got to understand that you can never beat the bandit, no

and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
when she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
and there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
and all that is said is that you've drank a lot

around three o'clock
when the two-for-ones have done the writer's block
have you got color in your cheeks?
do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
that sticks around like summat in your teeth?
are there some aces up your sleeve?
have you no idea that you're in deep?
i've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
how many secrets can you keep?
'cause there's this tune i found
that makes me think of you somehow and i play it on repeat
until i fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

(do i wanna know?) if this feelin' flows both ways?
(sad to see you go) was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(baby, we both know) that the nights were mainly made
for sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

crawlin' back to you
ever thought of callin' when
you've had a few?
'cause i always do
maybe i'm too
busy bein' yours
to fall for somebody new
now, i've thought it through
crawlin' back to you

so have you got the guts?
been wonderin' if your heart's still open
and if so, i wanna know what time it shuts
simmer down an' pucker up, i'm sorry to interrupt
it's just i'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
i don't know if you feel the same as i do
but we could be together if you wanted to

(do i wanna know?) if this feelin' flows both ways?
(sad to see you go) was sorta hopin' that you'd stay

i'm a puppet on a string
tracy island, time-traveling
diamond cutter-shaped heartaches
come to find you four in some velvet morning
years too late, she's a silver lining
lone ranger riding through an open space
in my mind when she's not right there beside me

i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself, all i
wanna hear her say is "are you mine?"
well, are you mine?
are you mine?
are you mine? oh, ah

i guess what i'm tryna say is i need the deep end
keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
unfair, we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
great escape, lost track of time and space
she's a silver lining climbing on my desire

and i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself, all i
wanna hear her say is "are you mine?"
well, are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
are you mine? (or just mine tonight?)
are you mine? (are you mine?)
oh ah

and the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
so in case, i'm mistaken, i
just wanna hear you say, "you got me, baby, are you mine?"

she's a silver lining
lone ranger riding through an open space
that's a big shadow

in my mind when she's not right there beside me
i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself, all i
wanna hear her say is "are you mine?"
well, are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
are you mine? (or just mine tonight?)
are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
oh ah (or just mine tonight?)

outside the cafe by the cracker factory
you were practicing a magic trick
and my thoughts got rude, as you talked and chewed
on the last of your pick and mix

said, "you're mistaken if you're thinking that i haven't been called "cold" before"
as you bit into your strawberry lace
and then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
is all you had left and it was going to waste

your pastimes, consisted of the strange
and twisted and deranged
and i love that little game you had called
"crying lightning"
and how you like to aggravate the ice-cream man on rainy afternoons

the next time that i caught my own reflection
it was on it's way to meet you
thinking of excuses to postpone
you never looked like yourself from the side
but your profile could not hide
the fact you knew i was approaching your throne

with folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
stood and puffed your chest out like you never lost a war
and though i tried so not to suffer the indignity of a reaction
there was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

and your pastimes, consisted of the strange
and twisted and deranged
and i hate that little game you had called
"crying lightning"
and how you like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons

uninviting
but not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are
crying lightning

and your pastimes, consisted of the strange
and twisted and deranged
and i hate that little game you had called
"crying lightning"
"crying lightning", oh
"crying lightning"
"crying lightning"

your pastimes, consisted of the strange
and twisted and deranged
and i hate that little game you had called
"crying"
we are arctic monkeys and this is 
"i bet you look good on the dancefloor"
don't believe the hype

stop making the eyes at me
i'll stop making the eyes at you
what it is that surprises me
is that i don't really want you to

and your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
your name isn't rio, but i don't like the sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
from 1984

i wish you'd stop ignoring me
because you're sending me to despair
without a sound, yeah, you're calling me
and i don't think it's very fair

your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
your name isn't rio, but i don't like the sand

i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor

from 1984

oh, there ain't no love, no montagues or capulets
just banging tunes and dj sets and
dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness
oh, come back

well, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dance floor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984

where i ponder all the questions
but just manage to miss the mark

ooh-ooh
good afternoon
tranquility base hotel and casino
mark speaking

this magical thinking
feels as if it really might catch on
mama wants some answers
do you remember where it all went wrong?
technological advances

kiss me underneath the moon's side boob

good afternoon
tranquility base hotel and casino
mark speaking

when the two-for-ones have done the writer's block, woah

i've got just one more question for you
trudging through the morning
the tramp with the trampoline under his arm
shifts past your whiskers
so stark is a charm but the barking alarm
waits coiled 'til the corner is turned

and the bicycle wheels all struggle to move 'round
in your muddy mind, blatantly caked
and unwilling to wind uncooperative time
so she sits on the springs 'til the muck goes dry 

ooh

all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast
the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast
the shadow of a snake pit on the

what came first, the chicken or the dickhead?
split sleep reaps rewards from ill-fitting thoughts
a twilight force, she doesn't wanna walk
your legs start running and your leg gets caught
canopy 19 is perfectly placed for the reasonably frightening
fall from the aftertaste, you'll have to slip away
i am unhappy to say
behold as the crook in the hammock plays

all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast
the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast
the shadow of a snake pit on the wall

let's play darts

behold as a crook in the hammock plays
cruelly with the base and the scales
and fiddles with her feet on a balancing act
gagged, bound and crafting a tale
trailing wrapped in a gasp

cruelly with the base and the scales
and fucking fiddles with her feet on a balancing act
she was gagged, bound and crafting a tale
trailing wrapped in a gasp

all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast
the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast
the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
fiendish wonder in the carnival's wake 
dull caresses once again irritate
tread softly, stranger 
move over toward the danger that you seek 

you think excitement has receded then the mirror distracts
the logic of the trance quickly reaches and grasps
handsome and faceless
and weightless, your imagination runs

and now it's no one's fault but yours 
at the foot of the house of cards 
you thought you'd never get obsessed 
you thought the wolves would be impressed 
and you're a sinking stone 
but you know what it's like to hold the jeweler's hands 
that procession of pioneers all drowned 

in the moonlight they're more thrilling 
those things that he knows 
as he leads you through the grinning 
bubble blowers in the snow 
watching his exit 
was like falling off the ferry in the night 

the inevitables gather to push you around 
any other voice makes such a punishing sound
he became laughter's assassin 
shortly after he showed you what it was 

and now it's no one's fault but yours 
at the foot of the house of cards 
you thought you'd never get obsessed 
you thought the wolves would be impressed 
and you're a sinking stone 
but you know what it's like to hold the jeweler's hands 
that procession of pioneers all drowned 

if you've a lesson to teach me
i'm listening, ready to learn 
there's no one here to police me
i'm sinking in until you return 

if you've a lesson to teach
please don't deviate, don't be afraid 
without the last corner piece, i can't calibrate
let's get it ingrained

when you left the house this evening
you said you'd be back in a little while
but i've been waiting for such a long time
and this waiting is driving me wild

and while i wait, i think about you
do you need me and i'm not there?
are you planning to be without me?
do you have a new affair?

you're a bad, bad woman
you're a bad, bad woman

pictures of you keep flashing through my mind
if you would only call, if you would be so kind
imagine things, i see another man
and it's this waiting i just can't stand

you're a bad, bad woman
you're a bad, bad woman
you're a bad, bad woman
you're a bad, bad woman
show us your special move

well, this is a good idea
he wouldn't do it if it wasn't
he wouldn't do it if it wasn't one
well, my friend fancies you
oh, what a way to begin it all
you said, "they're always exciting words to hear"
and they woke up together not quite realizing how
awkwardly stretching and yawning
it's always hard in the morning

and i suppose that's the price you pay
well, oh, it isn't what it was
she's thinking he looks different today
and now there's nothing left to guess now

they left before the lights came on
because they didn't want to ruin what it was that was brewing
before they absolutely had to
and how can you wake up with someone you don't love
and not feel slightly fazed by it?
oh, he had a struggle
and they woke up together not quite realizing how

awkwardly stretching and yawning
it's always hard in the morning

and i suppose that's the price you pay
well, oh, it isn't what it was
she's thinking he looks different today
and now there's nothing left to guess now

well, quick, let's leave before the lights come on
'cause then you don't have to see
'cause then you don't have to see what you've done
well, quick, let's leave before the lights come on
'cause then you don't have to see
'cause then you don't have to see what you've done

for sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

anticipation has a habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah, regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen
the lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
of course it's fancy dress
and they're all looking quite forlorn in bunny ears and devil horns and how

i want to see all of the things that we've already seen

i wanna see you take the jackpot out the fruit machine
and put it all back in
you've got to understand that you can never beat the bandit, no

and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
when she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
and there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
and all that is said is that you've drank a lot

and you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind, yeah
you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind

and you can pour your heart out
for a reason it would block
oh, you send her after nine o'clock

and you can pour your heart out
around three o'clock
when the two-for-ones have done the writer's block
one, two, three, four (roll that faster, man)
one, two, three, four (oh, we gotta time that)
(the whole point of a count is that it's in time, in it?)
one, two, three, four

well, i watch you tangle every weekend
it might start different but it ends up the same
one minute, you're casually speaking
the next it all goes up and you pour fuel on the flame
with your jerry can of words and tones

and no one's gonna start a revolution
so we best leave it well alone
and there's something that frankie used to say
apparently

oh, he said, settle for a draw
well, you're not gonna get no more
so you should settle for a draw
i told you once i'm sure, i told you once i'm sure
you should settle for a draw
why don't you settle for a draw?

well, you're right, it is one set of rules for her
and then another set for you
but that's just the way it is, i suppose
and there's nowt you can do
and let's not fall in the trap of answering back
i am just a beginner but she'll be the only winner
that's for sure, so take the draw, if it's available
and if it sets on fire
don't get out your jerry can of words and tones

and no one's gonna start a revolution
so we best leave it well alone
and there's something that frankie used to say
apparently

oh, he said, settle for a draw
well, you're not gonna get no more
so you should settle for the draw
i told you once i'm sure, i told you once i'm sure

i thought i saw you in the battleship
but it was only a look alike
she was nothing but a vision trick
under the warning light
she was close
close enough to be your ghost
but my chances turned to toast
when i asked her if i could call her your name

i thought i saw you in the rusty hook
huddled up in wicker chair
i wandered up for a closer look
and kissed whoever was sitting there
she was close
and she held me very tightly
'til i asked awfully politely
"please, can i call you her name?"

and i elongated my lift home
yeah, i let him go the long way 'round
i smelt your scent on the seatbelt
and kept my shortcuts to myself

i thought i saw you in the parrot's beak
messin' with the smoke alarm
it was too loud for me to hear her speak
and she had a broken arm
it was close
so close that the walls were wet
and she wrote it out in letraset
"no, you can't call me her name"

tell me, where's your hiding place?
i'm worried i'll forget your face
and i've asked everyone
i'm beginning to think i imagined you all along

i elongated my lift home
yeah, i let him go the long way 'round
i smelt your scent on the seatbelt
and kept my shortcuts to myself

i saw your sister in the cornerstone
on the phone to the middle man
when i saw that she was on her own
i thought she might understand
that she was close
well, you couldn't get much closer
she said, "i'm really not supposed to, but yes
you can call me anything you want"
007 and brucey wayne
are shitting there 'selves because there's another name coming to claim
what is his to claim
10% faster with a sturdier frame

he's certainly come into his own
there's one on his arm in every land that he roams
and two consecutive nights alone
are a thing of the past as he has recently shown

they said he looks so handsome stood not dancing
drawing you in like it's boring to him
it's a war you can't win and the first and the last are two things you'll never
be my darling

another roll around and another push and shove
further away from the idea of love
and his conclusion it must be good
oh wouldn't the penny would drop with an incredible thud
they forgot to kick the tin, he knows where she's going
but don't know where she's been
and as opposed to the other thing
he'll worry about it when it's trouble he's in

they said he looks so handsome stood not dancing
drawing you in like it's boring to him
it's a war you can't win and the first and the last are two
things you'll never be my darling

things you'll never be my darling

(two things you will never be my darling)

(two things you'll never be my darling)

well they sneered and sniffed and spat at my chat up lines
not to feel like a twat at times is hard
(but not for this kid, not when they come to you)
i like the way you look at me baby
please don't try and turn on the lights
i act as if i'm not going crazy
girl i'm in a muddle tonight
would you tell me where you're gonna take it
if i had a heart you're the one who should break it
the engines running, can't decide if i should ride away

you and i
you and i

i had a woman, she went away
and now i'm lonely, f*ck it

you and i
you and i

you and i
you and i

would you tell me where you're gonna take it
if i had a heart you're the one who should break it

the engines running, can't decide if i should ride away
you and i
you and i

you and i
you and i

you and i
you and i

i like the way you look at me baby
please don't go and turn out the lights
i act as if i'm not going crazy
girl, i'm in a muddle tonight
sketchead is coming to your party
he's walking up your drive and he's swinging all his keys around
sketchead, he's seen you with your top off
he already knows your boyfriend, retain your introductions
sketchead, that cumbersome protagonist
the pips in your quince, the eye behind the spy hole
the itch you can't itch in your ear
and the knock that shattered your packet of peppermints

sketchead, there's poison in his spit
he'll compliment your tits and leave you to your wits
sketchead, convincingly insisting
the tires were bald when you gave him the car
sketchead, still coming to your party
still walking up your drive and still swinging all his keys around
on his finger as a pendulum to unnerve

and then there's you, you've changed
i approached you like you were the same
but soon it was apparent a new name was required
new lips went and fired accomplishments at me
while i'm captivated by your magazine skin
the tint on your lenses obscures to begin
and you know full well
that anyone who says that they don't prefer the sequel
will still be swinging on themselves tonight
she was marrying a matador and he was with the weather girl
a very clever girl who stood out among several once
a terrible dilemma and forever he'll regret this day he didn't make the
rescue from the bull ring
sulking won't get you nowhere son
there's blood on your chin where you've bitten your tongue
smitten but might not be smitten for long if you're still sitting she'll soon
be smitten and gone
been fighting with my sheets
and nearly crying in my sleep
yes, i'm battling that well taught gripe
the most restraining type
you should have racing stripes

the way you keep me in pursuit
sharpen the heel of your boot
and you press it to my chest and you make me wheeze
then to my knees you do promote me

i'm pinned down by the dark
a-n-i-m-a-l
makes my head pirouette
more than i won't be willing to confess
d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s

the light it fidgets through
the thoughts'll soon revert to you
about as bashful as a tribal dance
the first and final chance
and cause the audience

the frighteners and fiends
divided up into two teams
when the acrobat fell off the beam
she broke everyone's hearts

i'm pinned down by the dark
a-n-i-m-a-l
makes my head pirouette
more than i would be willing to confess
d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s

d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s
the most unsuitable pet
it's been long enough now so let's
make a mess lioness

pinned down by the dark
i'm pinned down by the dark

d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s
a-n-i-m-a-l
d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s
a-n-i-m-a-l
the mirror's image
it tells me it's home time
but i'm not finished
'cause you're not by my side

and as i arrived i thought i saw you leaving
carrying your shoes
decided that once again i was just dreaming
of bumping into you

now it's three in the morning
and i'm trying to change your mind
left you multiple missed calls
and to my message you reply
why'd you only call me when you're high?
high
why'd you only call me when you're high?

somewhere darker
talking the same shite
i need a partner
well are you out tonight?

it's harder and harder to get you to listen
more i get through the gears
incapable of making alright decisions
and having bad ideas

now it's three in the morning
and i'm trying to change your mind
left you multiple missed calls
and to my message you reply
(message you reply)
why'd you only call me when you're high?
(why'd you only call me when you're)
high
why'd you only call me when you're high?

and i can't see you here when i'm high
sort of feels like i'm running out of time
i haven't found all i was hoping to find
you said you got to be up in the morning
gonna have an early night
and you starting to bore me, baby
why'd you only call me when you're high?

why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?

why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
