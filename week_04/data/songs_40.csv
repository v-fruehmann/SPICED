Arctic Monkeys,"Religious iconography giving you the creeps? I feel rougher than a disco lizard tongue along your cheek The rise of the machines I must admit you gave me something momentarily In which I could believe But the hand of harsh reality's un-gloved And it's on its way back in to scoop you up But not on my watch  I won't stay with you, my love The way some science fiction does  Reflections in the silver screen of strange societies Swamp monster with a hard on for connectivity The ascension of the cream Mass panic on a not too distant future colony Quantitative easing I want to make a simple point about peace and love But in a sexy way where it's not obvious  Highlight dangers and send out hidden messages The way some science fiction does The way some science fiction does  I've got the world on a wire In my little mirror mirror on the wall In the pocket of my raincoat  So I tried to write a song to make you blush But I've a feeling that the whole thing May well just end up too clever for its own good The way some science fiction does"
Arctic Monkeys,"One, two, three, four  She looks like fun She looks like fun She looks like fun She looks like  Smile like you've got a straw in something tropical I've got the party plugged right into my skull Wayne Manor, what a memorable N.Y.E  (She looks like fun) Good morning (She looks like fun) Cheeseburger (She looks like fun) Snowboarding (She looks like)  Finally, I can share with you through cloudy skies Every whimsical thought that enters my mind There's no limit to the length of the dickheads we can be  (She looks like fun) Bukowski (She looks like fun) Dogsitting (She looks like fun) Screwballing (She looks like)  Finally, there's a place where you can wag your tongue Baby, but why can't we all just get along? Dance as if somebody's watching, 'cause they are  No one's on the streets We moved it all online As of March I'm so full of shite I need to spend less time stood around in bars Waffling on to strangers all about martial arts And how much I respect them  (She looks like fun) Key changes (She looks like fun) Re-thinking (She looks like fun) New order (She looks like fun)"
Arctic Monkeys,"I want an interesting synonym To describe this thing That you say we're all grandfathered in I'll use the search engine (we've got much to discuss) Too much to discuss Over a bucket of balls I can recall the glow of your low beams It's the big night in Tinsel City Life became a spectator sport I launch my fragrance called ""Integrity"" I sell the fact that I can't be bought Have I told you all about the time That I got sucked into a hole through a hand held device? I will flashback now and again but I'm usually alright Thankfully the process has been simplified Since the last time you tried  I've recognized the glow of your low beams numerous times I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold Making a selection Opening credits roll Panoramic windows looking out across your soul  You go in through the door Vengeance trilogy wallpaper walls They have re-decorated it all They've changed all the lights and the bar's down the side  I've recognized the glow of your low beams numerous times Through fairly opaque blinds in the sitting room Vehicles will pass by but I know when it's you I'll be in a nose dive in my flying shoes Right behind your closed eyes like a memory from your youth I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold Making a selection Opening credits roll Killer pink flamingos Computer controlled Panoramic windows looking out across your soul"
Arctic Monkeys,"Still got pictures of friends on the wall I suppose we aren't really friends anymore Maybe I shouldn't ever have called That thing friendly at all Get freaked out from a knock at the door When I haven't been expecting one Didn't that used to be part of the fun, once upon a time? We'll be there at the back of the bar In a booth like we usually were Every time there was a rocket launch Or some big event  What a death I died writing that song Start to finish, with you looking on It stays between us, Steinway and his sons 'Cause it's the ultracheese Perhaps it's time that you went for a walk And dress like a fictional character From a place they called America In the golden age Trust the politics to come along When you were just trying to orbit the sun When you were just about to be kind to someone Because you had the chance  I've still got pictures of friends on the wall I might look as if I'm deep in thought But the truth is I'm probably not If I ever was  Oh, the dawn won't stop weighing a tonne I've done some things that I shouldn't have done But I haven't stopped loving you once"
Arctic Monkeys,"So when you gaze at planet earth from outer space Does it wipe that stupid look off of your face? I saw this aura over the battleground states I lost the money, lost the keys But I'm still handcuffed to the briefcase  And I never thought, not in a million years That I'd meet so many lovers Can I please have my money back? My virtual reality mask is stuck on ""Parliament Brawl"" Emergency battery pack just in time For my weekly chat with God on video call  Breaking news, they take the truth and make it and fluid The trainer's explanation was accepted by the steward A montage of the latest ancient ruins Soundtracked by a chorus of ""you don't know what you're doing""  And I never thought, not in a million years That I'd meet so many lovers  And all of my most muscular regrets explode Behind my eyes like American sports  And I never thought, not in a million years That I'd meet so many lovers"
Arctic Monkeys,"Mad sounds in your ears, they make you feel alright They bring you back to life Mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance They make you get up Yeah they make you get up  Love buckles under the strain of those wild nights Run but you cannot hide Mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance They make you get up All night long they reappear They make you get up and dance Yeah they make you get up  Suppose you've gotta do what you gotta do We just weren't feeling how we wanted to You sit and try sometimes but you just can't figure out what went wrong Then out of nowhere somebody comes and hits you with an Ooh la la la, ooh la la la Ooh la la la ooh Ooh la la la, ooh la la la Ooh la la la ooh  You got those mad sounds in your ears to make you get up and dance Mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance They make you get up"
Arctic Monkeys,"Well the times are so a'changing Baby even when it's live You can press pause and rewind  You knew it would go amazing But is this what you had in mind? Oh there's nothing you can't find  It's two thousand and thirteen All across the galaxy It's two thousand and thirteen (Yeah)  On the back of a transmitter There's a little shiny fruit And it's coming after you  As for Instagram and Twitter She got caught in both lassoes And neither one will cut her loose  It's two thousand and thirteen All across the galaxy It's two thousand and thirteen (Yeah) Yeah  So baby take a walk with me Past flying cars and time machines There's magic like you won't believe, no  It's two thousand and thirteen All across the galaxy It's two thousand and thirteen All across the galaxy"
