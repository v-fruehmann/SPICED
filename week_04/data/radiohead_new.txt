then in your life, there comes the darkness
there's a spacecraft blocking out the sky
and there's nowhere to hide
you run to the back and you cover your ears
but it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
and are we trapped? rag-doll, cloth people
we are helpless to resist
into our darkest hour

but it was just a laugh, just a laugh
just a laugh, just a laugh
even at this angle
and so we crumble
a ten ton head, made of wet sand
this dread circumference
you gotta be kidding me
the grass grows over me
your face in the glass, in the glass
it was just a laugh, just a laugh
it's whatever you say it is
split infinity

a job that slowly kills you
bruises that won't heal
you look so tired, unhappy
bring down the government
they don't, they don't speak for us
i'll take a quiet life
a handshake of carbon monoxide

with no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
silent, silent

this is my final fit
my final bellyache

with no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises, please

such a pretty house
and such a pretty garden

no alarms and no surprises

i don't want to be crippled and cracked
shoulders and wrists, knees and back
ground to dust and ash
crawling on all fours
when you've got to feel it in your bones
when you've got to feel it in your bones
now i can't climb the stairs
pieces missing everywhere
prozak painkillers
when you've got to feel it in your bones
when you've got to feel it in your bones
i used to fly like peter pan
all the children flew when i touched their hands
you see, you've got to feel it in your bones
you see, you've got to feel it in your bones
ah-ah
two jumps in a week
i bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you boy?
flying on your motorcycle
watching all the ground beneath you drop

kill yourself for recognition
kill yourself to never ever stop
you broke another mirror
you're turning into something you are not

don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry

drying up in conversation
you will be the one who cannot talk
all your insides fall to pieces
you just sit there wishing you could still make love

they're the ones who'll hate you
when you think you've got the world all sussed out
they're the once who'll spit at you
you'll be the one screaming out

don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry

oh, it's the best thing that you ever had
the best thing you ever, ever had
it's the best thing that you ever had
the best thing you have had is gone away

faith, you're driving me away
you do it everyday
you don't mean it but it hurts like hell

my brain says i'm receiving pain
a lack of oxygen from my life support
my iron lung

we're too young to fall asleep
too cynical to speak
we are loosing it, can't you tell?

we scratch our eternal itch
our twentieth century bitch and we are grateful for our
iron lung

suck, suck your teenage thumb
toilet trained and dumb
when the power runs out we'll just hum

this this is our new song
just like the last one
a total waste of time
my iron lung

if you're frightened
you can be frightened
you can be, it's okay 

if you're frightened
you can be frightened
you can be, it's okay
can't get the stink off
he's been hanging around for days
comes like a comet
suckered you but not your friends

one day he'll get to you
and teach you how to be a holy cow

you do it to yourself, you do
and that's what really hurts
is you do it to yourself, just you
you and no-one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself

don't get my sympathy, hanging out the fifteenth floor
you've changed the locks three times
he still comes reeling through the door
one day i'll get to you
and teach you how to get to purest hell

you do it to yourself you do
and that's what really hurts
is you do it to yourself, just you
you and no-one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself

you do it to yourself you do
and that's what really hurts
is you do it to yourself just you
you and no-one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself, whoa

say, hey

you do it to yourself, you do it to yourself
yeah, yeah, you do it to yourself, yes-yes, you
do it to yourself
the breath of the morning
i keep forgetting
the smell of the warm summer air

i live in a town
where you can't smell a thing
you watch your feet
for cracks in the pavement

up above
aliens hover
making home movies
for the folks back home

of all these weird creatures
who lock up their spirits
drill holes in themselves
and live for their secrets

they're all
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight

oh

i wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
late at night when i'm driving
take me on board their beautiful ship
show me the world as i'd love to see it

i'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
they'd think that i'd finally lost it completely
i'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
they'd shut me away
but i'd be alright
alright
i'm alright
alright

i'm just
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight

i jumped in the river, what did i see?
black-eyed angels swam with me
a moon full of stars and astral cars
and all the figures i used to see

all my lovers were there with me
all my past and futures
and we all went to heaven in a little row boat
there was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt

finally i'm free of all the weight i've been carrying

when at last you'll give in
when at last you'll give in

wake me up
wake me up
wake me up
wake me up
wake me up
wake me up
when you were here before
couldn't look you in the eye
you're just like an angel
your skin makes me cry

you float like a feather
in a beautiful world
i wish i was special
you're so fuckin' special

but i'm a creep, i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doing here?
i don't belong here

i don't care if it hurts
i wanna have control
i wanna a perfect body
i wanna a perfect soul

i want you to notice
when i'm not around
you're so fuckin' special
i wish i was special

but i'm a creep, i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doing here?
i don't belong here

she's running out again
she's running out
she's run run run run

whatever makes you happy
whatever you want
you're so fuckin' special
i wish i was special

but i'm a creep, i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doing here?
i don't belong here

you got some nerve, coming here
you got some nerve, coming here
you stole it all, give it back

good morning, mr. magpie
how are we today?
and now you stole it, all the magic
took my memories

(oh)
(no no no no no no)

you know you should, but you don't
you know you should, but you don't

good morning, mr. magpie
how are we today?
and now you stole it, all the magic
took my melody
reckoner
you can't take it with you
dancing for your pleasure
 
you are not to blame for
bittersweet distractors
dare not speak its name
dedicated to all human beings
 
because we separate
like ripples on a blank shore
in rainbows
because we separate
the ripples on a black shore
 
reckoner, take me with you
 
dedicated to all human beings
open your mouth wide
a universal sigh
and while the ocean blooms
it's what keeps me alive
so why does this still hurt?
don't blow your mind with why

i'm moving out of orbit
(turning in somersaults)
turning in somersaults
(a giant turtle's eyes)
a giant turtle's eyes
(and jellyfish float by)
and jellyfish float by

(it's what keeps me alive)
rows of houses, all bearing down on me
i can feel their blue hands touching me
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
and fade out again and fade out

this machine will, will not communicate
these thoughts and the strain i am under
be a world child, form a circle
before we all go under
and fade out again and fade out again

cracked eggs, dead birds
scream as they fight for life
i can feel death, can see its beady eyes
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
fade out again
fade out again

immerse your soul in love
immerse your soul in love
when you were here before
couldn't look you in the eye
you're just like an angel
your skin makes me cry

you float like a feather
in a beautiful world

outstepping

the lunatics have taken over the asylum
waiting on the rapture

singing, "we're here to keep your prices down
we'll feed you to the hounds
to the daily mail, to get up, together"

you made a pig's ear, you made a mistake
paid off security and got through the gate
you got away with it but we lie in wait, eh
eh, eh

where's the truth what's the use
i'm hanging around lost and found
and when you're here innocent
fat chance, no plan
no regard for human life

you'll keep time, you've no right
you're fast to lose, you will lose
you jumped the queue, you're back again

president for life, love of all
the flies in the sky, the beasts of the earth
the fish in the sea have lost command
i walk down the staircase, 
magnetic pull.
back to the other place
that i cannot go.
i'm sending a chopper, 
to steal you away.

the pot is full, 
let me take control, 
let me take control.

the pot is full
of secrets to be told, 
secrets to be told.

out of orbit
and i always will.

the pot is full, 
let me take control, 
let me take control.

so now i'll set you free
i'll set you free

'cause all i want is the moon upon a stick
just to see what if
just to see what is
the bird lights float into my room

slowly we unfurl
as lotus flowers
'cause all i want is the moon upon a stick
i dance around the pit
the darkness is beneath
i can't kick your habit
just to feed your fast ballooning head
listen to your heart
slight of hand
jump off the end
into a clear lake
no one around
just dragonflies
fantasize
no one gets hurt

you've done nothing wrong
slide your hand
jump off the end
the water's clear
and innocent
the water's clear
and innocent
don't hurt me

it's like i'm fallen out of bed
from a long, weary dream
the sweetest flowers and fruits are hanging from trees
falling off the giant bird that's been carrying me
it's like i've fallen out of bed
from a long and vivid dream
just exactly as i remember
every word
every gesture

and my heart, in my mouth
like i'm fallen out of bed
from a long and vivid dream
finally i'm free of all the weight i've been carrying

and as that woman blows her cover
in the eye of the beholder
i'm a fish now out of water
falling off a giant bird that's been carrying me

i fell open
i laid under
at the tip out
i was just your number
i want stay on it
and get back under

if you think this is over
then you're wrong
(wake me up, wake me up)

well of course i'd like to stay and chew the fat
well of course i'd like to sit around and chat

i can feel death, can see its beady eyes
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
fade out again

all the things you got,
all the things you need
who bought you cigarettes,
who bribed the company to come and see you, honey

i've been thinking about you, so how can you sleep?
these people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet
they don't know what i know
why should you care when i'm not there?

been thinking about you, and there's no rest
should i still love you, still see you in bed
when i'm playing with myself?

we scratch our eternal itch
our twentieth century bitch and we are grateful for our

toilet trained and dumb

i jumped in the river, what did i see?
black-eyed angels swam with me
a moon full of stars and astral cars
and all the figures i used to see

all my lovers were there with me
all my past and futures
and we all went to heaven in a little row boat
there was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt

all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
and fade out again and fade out

this machine will, will not communicate
these thoughts and the strain i am under
be a world child, form a circle
before we all go under
and fade out again and fade out again

cracked eggs, dead birds
scream as they fight for life
i can feel death, can see its beady eyes
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole

disappointed people, clinging on to bottles
when it comes it's so, so, disappointing

let down and hanging around
crushed like a bug in the ground
let down and hanging around

shell smashed, juices flowing
wings twitch, legs are going
don't get sentimental, it always ends up drivel
one day, i am gonna grow wings
a chemical reaction
hysterical and useless
hysterical and

let down and hanging around
crushed like a bug in the ground
let down and hanging around

let down
let down
let down

you know, you know where you are with
you know where you are with
floor collapsing, falling
bouncing back and one day, i am gonna grow wings

you can force it but it will not come
you can taste it but it will not form
you can crush it but it's always here
you can crush it but it's always near
chasing you home

saying, everything is broken
everyone is broken

you can force it but it will stay stung
you can crush it as dry as a bone
you can walk it home straight from school
you can kiss, you can break all the rules

but still, everything is broken
everyone is broken
everyone is, everyone is broken
everyone is, everything is broken

why can't you forget?
why can't you forget?

kill yourself for recognition
kill yourself to never ever stop
you broke another mirror
you're turning into something you are not

don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry

drying up in conversation
you will be the one who cannot talk
all your insides fall to pieces
you just sit there wishing you could still make love

they're the ones who'll hate you
when you think you've got the world all sussed out
they're the once who'll spit at you
you'll be the one screaming out

don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry

oh, it's the best thing that you ever had
the best thing you ever, ever had
it's the best thing that you ever had
the best thing you have had is gone away

d-don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
faith, you're driving me away
you do it everyday
you don't mean it but it hurts like hell

my brain says i'm receiving pain
a lack of oxygen from my life support
my iron lung

we're too young to fall asleep
too cynical to speak
we are loosing it, can't you tell?

we scratch our eternal itch
our twentieth century bitch and we are grateful for our
iron lung

suck, suck your teenage thumb
toilet trained and dumb
when the power runs out we'll just hum

this this is our new song
just like the last one
a total waste of time
my iron lung

if you're frightened
you can be frightened
you can be, it's okay 

if you're frightened
you can be frightened
you can be, it's okay
in pitch dark
i go walking in your landscape
broken branches
trip me as i speak

just 'cause you feel it
doesn't mean it's there
just 'cause you feel it
doesn't mean it's there

there's always a siren
singing you to shipwreck
(don't reach out, don't reach out
don't reach out, don't reach out)
steer away from these rocks
we'd be a walking disaster
(don't reach out, don't reach out
don't reach out, don't reach out)

just 'cause you feel it
doesn't mean it's there
(someone on your shoulder
someone on your shoulder)
just 'cause you feel it
doesn't mean it's there
(someone on your shoulder
someone on your shoulder)
there there

why so green and lonely?
and lonely, and lonely?

heaven sent you to me
to me, to me?

we are accidents waiting
waiting to happen

we are accidents waiting
waiting to happen
in the next world war
in a jack knifed juggernaut
i am born again

in the neon sign
scrolling up and down
i am born again

in an interstellar burst
i am back to save the universe

in a deep, deep sleep
of the innocent
i am born again

in a fast german car
i'm amazed that i survived
an airbag saved my life

in an interstellar burst
i am back to save the universe

in an interstellar burst
i am back to save the universe

in an interstellar burst
i am back to save the universe
i might be wrong
i might be wrong
i could have sworn i saw a light coming on

i used to think
i used to think
there was no future left at all
i used to think

start again begin again
let's go down the waterfall
think about the good times and never go back
never go back

what would i do?
what would i do?
if i did not have you?

open up, let me in
let's go down the waterfall
have ourselves a good time
it's nothing at all
nothing at all
nothing at all

come back
come back
ah, ah
ah
something for the rag and bone man
over my dead body
something big is gonna happen
over my dead body

someone's son or someone's daughter
over my dead body
this is how i end up sucked in
over my dead body

i'm gonna go to sleep
let this wash all over me

we don't really want a monster taking over
tiptoe around, tie him down
we don't want the loonies taking over
tiptoe around, tie them down

may pretty horses
come to you
as you sleep
i'm gonna go to sleep
and let this wash all over me
transport, motorways and tramlines
starting and then stopping
taking off and landing
the emptiest of feelings
disappointed people, clinging on to bottles
when it comes it's so, so, disappointing

let down and hanging around
crushed like a bug in the ground
let down and hanging around

shell smashed, juices flowing
wings twitch, legs are going
don't get sentimental, it always ends up drivel
one day, i am gonna grow wings
a chemical reaction
hysterical and useless
hysterical and

let down and hanging around
crushed like a bug in the ground
let down and hanging around

let down
let down
let down

you know, you know where you are with
you know where you are with
floor collapsing, falling
bouncing back and one day, i am gonna grow wings
a chemical reaction (you know where you are)
hysterical and useless (you know where you are)
hysterical and (you know where you are)

let down and hanging around
crushed like a bug in the ground
let down and hanging around
you can force it but it will not come
you can taste it but it will not form
you can crush it but it's always here
you can crush it but it's always near
chasing you home

saying, everything is broken
everyone is broken

you can force it but it will stay stung
you can crush it as dry as a bone
you can walk it home straight from school
you can kiss, you can break all the rules

but still, everything is broken
everyone is broken
everyone is, everyone is broken
everyone is, everything is broken

why can't you forget?
why can't you forget?
why can't you forget?

a green plastic watering can
for a fake chinese rubber plant
in the fake plastic earth

that she bought from a rubber man
in a town full of rubber plans
to get rid of itself

it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out

she lives with a broken man
a cracked polystyrene man
who just crumbles and burns

he used to do surgery
for girls in the eighties
but gravity always wins

and it wears him out
it wears him out
it wears him out
wears him out

she looks like the real thing
she tastes like the real thing
my fake plastic love

but i can't help the feeling
i could blow through the ceiling
if i just turn and run

and it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out

and if i could be who you wanted
if i could be who you wanted

you reel me out then you cut the string

how come i end up where i started
how come i end up where i belong

you reel me out then you cut the string

you used to be alright
what happened?
did the cat get your tongue
did your string come undone
one by one
one by one
it comes to us all
it's as soft as your pillow

you used to be alright
what happened?
etcetera etcetera
facts for whatever
fifteen steps

how come i end up where i started
how come i end up where i belong
won't take my eyes off the ball again
you reel me out then you cut the string
i do not
understand
what it is
i've done wrong
full of holes
check for pulse
blink your eyes
one for yes
two for no

i have no idea what i am talking about
i'm trapped in this body and can't get out
oh, oh

make a sound
move back home
pale imitation
with the edges
sawn off

i have no idea what you are talking about
i'm trapped in this body and can't get out

'cause the light's gone for me
it is the 21st century

they got scared and they put me in
they got scared and they put me in
all the lies run around my face

don't get any big ideas
they're not gonna happen

you paint yourself white
and fill up with noise
there'll be something missing

now that you've found it
it's gone
now you feel it, you don't
you've gone off the rails

so don't get any big ideas
they're not gonna happen
you'll go to hell
for what your
dirty mind is thinking
in the deepest ocean
the bottom of the sea
your eyes
they turn me
why should i stay here?
why should i stay?

i'd be crazy not to follow
follow where you lead
your eyes
they turn me

turn me on to phantoms
i follow to the edge of the earth
and fall off
everybody leaves
if they get the chance
and this is my chance

i get eaten by the worms
weird fishes
get towed by the worms
weird fishes
weird fishes
weird fishes

i'll hit the bottom
hit the bottom and escape
escape

i'll hit the bottom
hit the bottom and escape

i'm an animal
trapped in your parked car
i am holidays
that you choose to ignore

you are all i need
you are all i need
i'm in the middle of your picture
lying in the leaves

i am a moth
who just wants to share your light
i'm just an insect
trying to get out of the night

i only stick with you
because there are no others

you are all i need
you are all i need
i'm in the middle of your picture
lying in the leaves

in pretty patterns
fingers in the blackbird pie
i'm tingling tingling tingling
it's what you feel now
what you ought to, what you ought to
reasonable and sensible
dead from the neck up
because i'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
we thought you had it in you
but no, no, no
for no real reason

squeeze the tubes and empty bottles
take a bow take a bow take a bow
it's what you feel now
what you ought to
what you ought to
an elephant thats in the room is
tumbling tumbling tumbling
in duplicate and duplicate
plastic bags and
duplicate and triplicate
dead from the neck up
guess i'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
we thought you had it in you
but no, no, no
exactly where do you get off
is enough is enough is enough
i love you but enough is enough, enough
a last stop
there's no real reason
reckoner
you can't take it with you
dancing for your pleasure
 
you are not to blame for
bittersweet distractors
dare not speak its name
dedicated to all human beings
 
because we separate
like ripples on a blank shore
in rainbows
because we separate
the ripples on a black shore
 
reckoner, take me with you
 
dedicated to all human beings
i don't want to be your friend
i just want to be your lover

denial, denial

the infrastructure will collapse
voltage spikes
throw your keys in the bowl
kiss your husband goodnight

forget about your house of cards

forget about your house of cards

denial, denial
your ears should be burning
just as you take my hand
just as you write my number down
just as the drinks arrive
just as they play your favorite song
as the magic disappears
no longer wound up like a spring
before you've had too much
come back and focus again

the walls abandon shape
you've got a cheshire cat grin
all blurring into one
this place is on a mission
before the night owl
before the animal noises
closed circuit cameras
before you're comatose

before you run away from me
before you're lost between the noise
the beat goes round and round
the beat goes round and round
i never really got there
i just pretended that i had
what's the point of instruments
words are a sawed off shotgun

come on and let it out
come on and let it out
come on and let it out
come on and let it out

before you run away from me
before you start unraveling
before you take my mic
just as you dance, dance, dance

jigsaws falling into place
there is nothing to explain
you eye each other as you pass
she looks back, you look back
not just once
not just twice
wish away the nightmare
wish away the nightmare
you've got a light you can feel it on your back
you've got a light you can feel it on your back
jigsaws falling into place
when i'm at the pearly gates
this will be on my videotape
my videotape

mephistopheles is just beneath
and he's reaching up to grab me

you are my center as i spin away
out of control on videotape

on videotape

this is my way of saying goodbye
because i can't do it face to face
i'm talking to you from my videotape

no matter what happens now
i won't be afraid
because i know today has been the most perfect day i have ever seen

pour yourself a hot bath
pour yourself a drink
nothing's gonna happen without warning

your future's bleak
you're so last week

ladies and gentlemen
without a safety net
i shall now perform a 180 flip-flop
i shall now amputate
i shall now contort

because down is the new up
what if i just flip-flop?

down is the new up
down is the new up
down is the new up

topsy turvy town
topsy turvy town


appliances have gone berserk
i cannot keep up
treading on people's toes
snot-nosed little punk

and i can't face the evening straight
and you can't offer me escape
houses move and houses speak
if you take me there you'll get relief
believe, believe, believe, believe

and if i'm gonna talk
i just wanna talk
please don't interrupt
just sit back and listen

'cause i can't face the evening straight
and you can't offer me escape
houses move and houses speak
if you take me there you'll get relief
believe, believe, believe, believe

standing in the hall
kicking out the wall

in the deepest ocean
the bottom of the sea
your eyes
they turn me
why should i stay here?
why should i stay?

i'd be crazy not to follow
follow where you lead
your eyes
they turn me

turn me on to phantoms
i follow to the edge of the earth
and fall off
everybody leaves
if they get the chance
and this is my chance

i get eaten by the worms
weird fishes
get towed by the worms
weird fishes
weird fishes
weird fishes

i'll hit the bottom
hit the bottom and escape
escape

i'll hit the bottom
hit the bottom and escape
escape
i'm the next act
waiting in the wings
i'm an animal
trapped in your parked car
i am holidays
that you choose to ignore

you are all i need
you are all i need
i'm in the middle of your picture
lying in the leaves

i am a moth
who just wants to share your light
i'm just an insect
trying to get out of the night

i only stick with you
because there are no others

you are all i need
you are all i need
i'm in the middle of your picture
lying in the leaves

it's all wrong
it's all right

it's all wrong
it's all wrong
it's all right
it's all wrong

one two three four

wakey wakey
rise and shine
it's on again, off again, on again
watch me fall
like domino's
in pretty patterns
fingers in the blackbird pie
i'm tingling tingling tingling
it's what you feel now
what you ought to, what you ought to
reasonable and sensible
dead from the neck up
because i'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
we thought you had it in you
but no, no, no
for no real reason

squeeze the tubes and empty bottles
take a bow take a bow take a bow
it's what you feel now
what you ought to
what you ought to
an elephant thats in the room is
tumbling tumbling tumbling
in duplicate and duplicate
plastic bags and
duplicate and triplicate
dead from the neck up
guess i'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
we thought you had it in you
but no, no, no
exactly where do you get off
is enough is enough is enough
i love you but enough is enough, enough
a last stop
there's no real reason
reckoner
you can't take it with yer
dancing for your pleasure

you are not to blame for
bittersweet distractors
dare not speak its name
dedicated to all human beings

because we separate
like ripples on a blank shore
in rainbows
because we separate
like ripples on a blank shore

reckoner
take me with yer
dedicated to all human beings
i don't want to be your friend
i just want to be your lover
no matter how it ends
no matter how it starts

forget about your house of cards
and i'll do mine
forget about your house of cards
and i'll do mine

fall off the table
get swept under
denial, denial

the infrastructure will collapse
voltage spikes
throw your keys in the bowl
kiss your husband goodnight

forget about your house of cards
and i'll do mine
forget about your house of cards
and i'll do mine

fall off the table
and get swept under

denial, denial
denial, denial
your ears should be burning
denial, denial
your ears should be burning
just as you take my hand
just as you write my number down
just as the drinks arrive
just as they play your favorite song
as the magic disappears
no longer wound up like a spring
before you've had too much
come back and focus again

the walls abandon shape
you've got a cheshire cat grin
all blurring into one
this place is on a mission
before the night owl
before the animal noises
closed circuit cameras
before you're comatose

before you run away from me
before you're lost between the noise
the beat goes round and round
the beat goes round and round
i never really got there
i just pretended that i had
what's the point of instruments
words are a sawed off shotgun

come on and let it out
come on and let it out
come on and let it out
come on and let it out

before you run away from me
before you start unraveling
before you take my mic
just as you dance, dance, dance

jigsaws falling into place
there is nothing to explain
you eye each other as you pass
she looks back, you look back
not just once
not just twice
wish away the nightmare
wish away the nightmare
you've got a light you can feel it on your back
you've got a light you can feel it on your back
jigsaws falling into place
when i'm at the pearly gates
this will be on my videotape
my videotape

mephistopheles is just beneath
and he's reaching up to grab me

out of control on videotape

this is my way of saying goodbye
because i can't do it face to face
i'm talking to you from my videotape

i won't be afraid
because i know today has been the most perfect day i have ever seen

your future's bleak
you're so last week

ladies and gentlemen
without a safety net
i shall now perform a 180 flip-flop

i shall now contort

because down is the new up
what if i just flip-flop?

appliances have gone berserk
i cannot keep up
treading on people's toes
snot-nosed little punk

and i can't face the evening straight
and you can't offer me escape
houses move and houses speak
if you take me there you'll get relief
believe, believe, believe, believe

and if i'm gonna talk
i just wanna talk
please don't interrupt
just sit back and listen

'cause i can't face the evening straight
and you can't offer me escape
houses move and houses speak
if you take me there you'll get relief
believe, believe, believe, believe

fifteen blows to your mind

you can force it but it will not come
you can taste it but it will not form
you can crush it but it's always here
you can crush it but it's always near
chasing you home

everyone is broken

you can force it but it will stay stung
you can crush it as dry as a bone
you can walk it home straight from school
you can kiss, you can break all the rules

when i need you
alone on an airplane
falling asleep against the windowpane
my blood will thicken

i need to wash myself again
to hide all the dirt and pain
'cause i'd be scared
that there's nothing underneath
and who are my real friends

talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
and i wish it was the sixties, i wish i could be happy
i wish, i wish, i wish that something would happen

where do we go from here?
the planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
and where are you?

the tanks and the whole marines to blow me away
to blow me sky-high

drying up in conversation
you will be the one who cannot talk
all your insides fall to pieces
you just sit there wishing you could still make love

they're the ones who'll hate you
when you think you've got the world all sussed out
they're the once who'll spit at you
you'll be the one screaming out

don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high

oh, it's the best thing that you ever had
the best thing you ever, ever had

a green plastic watering can
for a fake chinese rubber plant
in the fake plastic earth

that she bought from a rubber man
in a town full of rubber plans
to get rid of itself

it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out

she lives with a broken man
a cracked polystyrene man
who just crumbles and burns

he used to do surgery
for girls in the eighties
but gravity always wins

and it wears him out
it wears him out
it wears him out
wears him out

she looks like the real thing
she tastes like the real thing
my fake plastic love

but i can't help the feeling
i could blow through the ceiling
if i just turn and run

i don't want to be crippled and cracked
shoulders and wrists, knees and back
ground to dust and ash
crawling on all fours
when you've got to feel it in your bones
when you've got to feel it in your bones
now i can't climb the stairs
pieces missing everywhere
prozak painkillers
when you've got to feel it in your bones
when you've got to feel it in your bones
i used to fly like peter pan
all the children flew when i touched their hands
you see, you've got to feel it in your bones
you see, you've got to feel it in your bones
ah-ah
they love me like i was their brother
they protect me
listen to me
they dug me my very own garden
gave me sunshine
made me happy
nice dream

i call up my friend the good angel
but she's out with
her answer-phone
she says she'd love to come help but
the sea would
electrocute us all

can't get the stink off
he's been hanging around for days
comes like a comet
suckered you but not your friends

one day he'll get to you
and teach you how to be a holy cow

you do it to yourself, you do
and that's what really hurts
is you do it to yourself, just you
you and no-one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself

don't get my sympathy, hanging out the fifteenth floor
you've changed the locks three times
he still comes reeling through the door
one day i'll get to you
and teach you how to get to purest hell

you do it to yourself you do
and that's what really hurts
is you do it to yourself, just you
you and no-one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself

you do it to yourself you do

you do it to yourself, whoa

say, hey

you do it to yourself, you do it to yourself
yeah, yeah, you do it to yourself, yes-yes, you
do it to yourself
faith, you're driving me away
you do it everyday
you don't mean it but it hurts like hell

my brain says i'm receiving pain
a lack of oxygen from my life support
my iron lung

we're too young to fall asleep
too cynical to speak
we are loosing it, can't you tell?

we scratch our eternal itch
our twentieth century bitch and we are grateful for our
iron lung

suck, suck your teenage thumb
toilet trained and dumb
when the power runs out we'll just hum

this this is our new song
just like the last one
a total waste of time
my iron lung

if you're frightened
you can be frightened
you can be, it's okay 

if you're frightened
you can be frightened
you can be, it's okay
limb by limb and tooth by tooth
tearing up inside of me
every day every hour
i wish that i was bullet proof

wax me
mould me
heat the pins and stab them in
you have turned me into this
just wish that it was bullet proof

so pay the money and take a shot
leadfill the hole in me
i could burst a million bubbles
all surrogate and bullet proof

and bullet proof
and bullet proof
and bullet proof
i get home from work and you're still standing in your dressing gown
well what am i to do?
i know all the things around your head and what they do to you
what are we coming to?
what are we gonna do?

blame it on the black star
blame it on the falling sky
blame it on the satellite that beams me home

the troubled words of a troubled mind i try to understand what is eating you
i try to stay awake but its 58 hours since that i last slept with you
what are we coming to?
i just don't know anymore

blame it on the black star
blame it on the falling sky
blame it on the satellite that beams me home

i get on the train and i just stand about now that i don't think of you
i keep falling over i keep passing out when i see a face like you
what am i coming to?
i'm gonna melt down

blame it on the black star
blame it on the falling sky
blame it on the satellite that beams me home
this is killing me
this is killing me
you bite through the big wall, the big wall bites back
you just sit there and sulk, sit there and bawl
you are so pretty when you're on your knees
disinfected, eager to please

sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
god rest your soul
when the loving comes and we've already gone
just like your dad, you'll never change

each time it comes it eats me alive
i try to behave but it eats me alive
so i declare a holiday
fall asleep, drift away

sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
god rest your soul
when the loving comes and we've already gone
just like your dad, you'll never change

sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
god rest your soul
when the loving comes and we've already gone

rows of houses, all bearing down on me
i can feel their blue hands touching me
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
and fade out again and fade out

this machine will, will not communicate
these thoughts and the strain i am under
be a world child, form a circle
before we all go under
and fade out again and fade out again

cracked eggs, dead birds
scream as they fight for life
i can feel death, can see its beady eyes
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
fade out again
fade out again

immerse your soul in love
immerse your soul in love
in the next world war
in a jack knifed juggernaut
i am born again

in the neon sign
scrolling up and down
i am born again

in an interstellar burst
i am back to save the universe

in a deep, deep sleep
of the innocent
i am born again

in a fast german car
i'm amazed that i survived
an airbag saved my life

in an interstellar burst
i am back to save the universe

in an interstellar burst
i am back to save the universe

in an interstellar burst
i am back to save the universe
please could you stop the noise
i'm trying to get some rest
from all the unborn chicken voices in my head
what's that?
what's that?

when i am king, you will be first against the wall
with your opinion which is of no consequence at all
what's that?
what's that?

ambition makes you look pretty ugly
kicking, squealing gucci little piggy

the breath of the morning
i keep forgetting
the smell of the warm summer air

i live in a town
where you can't smell a thing
you watch your feet
for cracks in the pavement

up above
aliens hover
making home movies
for the folks back home

of all these weird creatures
who lock up their spirits
drill holes in themselves
and live for their secrets

they're all
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight

oh

i wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
late at night when i'm driving
take me on board their beautiful ship
show me the world as i'd love to see it

i'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
they'd think that i'd finally lost it completely
i'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
they'd shut me away
but i'd be alright
alright
i'm alright
alright

i'm just
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight

transport, motorways and tramlines
starting and then stopping
taking off and landing
the emptiest of feelings
disappointed people, clinging on to bottles
when it comes it's so, so, disappointing

fitter, happier
more productive
comfortable
not drinking too much
regular exercise at the gym, three days a week
getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
at ease
eating well, no more microwave dinners and saturated fats
a patient, better driver
a safer car, baby smiling in back seat
sleeping well, no bad dreams
no paranoia
careful to all animals, never washing spiders down the plughole
keep in contact with old friends, enjoy a drink now and then
will frequently check credit at moral bank, hole in wall
favours for favours, fond but not in love
charity standing orders on sundays, ring-road supermarket
no killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
car wash, also on sundays
no longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows, nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
nothing so childish
at a better pace, slower and more calculated
no chance of escape
now self-employed
concerned, but powerless
an empowered and informed member of societ, pragmatism not idealism
will not cry in public
less chance of illness
tires that grip in the wet, shot of baby strapped in backseat
a good memory
still cries at a good film
still kisses with saliva
no longer empty and frantic
like a cat
tied to a stick
that's driven into
frozen winter shit, the ability to laugh at weakness
calm, fitter, healthier and more productive
a pig in a cage on antibiotics

fifteen blows to the back of your head
fifteen blows to your mind

so lock the kids up safe tonight
shut the eyes in the cupboard
i've got the smell of a local man
who's got the loneliest feeling

that either way he turns
i'll be there
open up your skull
i'll be there

climbing up the walls
climbing up the walls
climbing up the walls
a heart that's full up like a landfill
a job that slowly kills you
bruises that won't heal
you look so tired, unhappy
bring down the government
they don't, they don't speak for us
i'll take a quiet life
a handshake of carbon monoxide

with no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
silent, silent

this is my final fit
my final bellyache

with no alarms and no surprises

and such a pretty garden

no alarms and no surprises

aliens hover
making home movies

who lock up their spirits
drill holes in themselves
and live for their secrets

late at night when i'm driving
take me on board their beautiful ship
show me the world as i'd love to see it

i'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
they'd think that i'd finally lost it completely
i'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
they'd shut me away
but i'd be alright
alright
i'm alright

bullets for hail.

any fool can easy pick a hole. (i only wish i could fall in)

a moving target in a firin' range.

scatterbrain.

lightning fuse
powercut.

over my dead body

we don't really want a monster taking over
tiptoe around, tie him down
we don't want the loonies taking over
tiptoe around, tie them down

come to you
as you sleep
i'm gonna go to sleep
and let this wash all over me
a green plastic watering can
for a fake chinese rubber plant
in the fake plastic earth

that she bought from a rubber man
in a town full of rubber plans
to get rid of itself

it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out

she lives with a broken man
a cracked polystyrene man
who just crumbles and burns

he used to do surgery
for girls in the eighties
but gravity always wins

and it wears him out
it wears him out
it wears him out
wears him out

she looks like the real thing
she tastes like the real thing
my fake plastic love

but i can't help the feeling
i could blow through the ceiling
if i just turn and run

and it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out

and if i could be who you wanted
if i could be who you wanted
all the time
all the time
i jumped in the river, what did i see?
black-eyed angels swam with me
a moon full of stars and astral cars
and all the figures i used to see

all my lovers were there with me
all my past and futures
and we all went to heaven in a little row boat
there was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt

in pitch dark 
i go walking in your landscape 
broken branches 
trip me as i speak 

just 'cause you feel it 
doesn't mean it's there 
just 'cause you feel it 
doesn't mean it's there 

there's always a siren 
singing you to shipwreck 
(don't reach out, don't reach out 
don't reach out, don't reach out) 

stay away from each rocks 
we'd be a walking disaster 
(don't reach out, don't reach out 
don't reach out, don't reach out) 

just 'cause you feel it 
doesn't mean it's there 
(someone on your shoulder 
someone on your shoulder)

doesn't mean it's there 
(someone on your shoulder 
someone on your shoulder) 

there there! 

why so green and lonely? 
lonely, lonely? 

heaven sent you to me 
to me, to me? 

we are accidents waiting 
waiting to happen 

we are accidents waiting 
waiting to happen
you are the sun the moon and stars 
ah you... and i could never run away from you 
you try at working out chaotic things 
and why should i believe myself? 

it's like the world is gonna end so soon 
and why should i believe myself? 

yeah... 

you, me, and everything 
caught in the fire 
i can see you drowning 
caught in the fire
soul destroyed with clever toys for little boys
it's inevitable, inevitable, it's a soul destroyed
you're free until you drop
you're free until you've had enough
and you don't understand
no ripcord, no ripcord
no ripcord, no ripcord

aeroplane do i mean what i mean?
oh it's inevitable, inevitable, oh aeroplane
a thousand miles an hour
on politics and power
that she don't understand
no ripcord, no ripcord
no ripcord, no ripcord

the answer to your prayers
we'll drop you anywhere

no ripcord, no ripcord
no ripcord, no no no no ripcord
oh yeah
i get home from work and you're still standing in your dressing gown
well what am i to do?
i know all the things around your head and what they do to you
what are we coming to?
what are we gonna do?

blame it on the black star
blame it on the falling sky
blame it on the satellite that beams me home

the troubled words of a troubled mind i try to understand what is eating you
i try to stay awake but its 58 hours since that i last slept with you
what are we coming to?
i just don't know anymore

blame it on the black star
blame it on the falling sky
blame it on the satellite that beams me home

i get on the train and i just stand about now that i don't think of you
i keep falling over i keep passing out when i see a face like you
what am i coming to?
i'm gonna melt down

blame it on the black star
blame it on the falling sky
blame it on the satellite that beams me home
this is killing me
this is killing me
faith, you're driving me away
you do it everyday
you don't mean it but it hurts like hell

my brain says i'm receiving pain
a lack of oxygen from my life support
my iron lung

we're too young to fall asleep
too cynical to speak
we are loosing it, can't you tell?

we scratch our eternal itch
our twentieth century bitch and we are grateful for our
iron lung

suck, suck your teenage thumb
toilet trained and dumb
when the power runs out we'll just hum

this this is our new song
just like the last one
a total waste of time
my iron lung

if you're frightened
you can be frightened
you can be, it's okay 

if you're frightened
you can be frightened
you can be, it's okay
i can't afford to breathe in this town 
nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand 
look back up to the cathode ray... 
i'm better off dead 
i'm better off dead 
i'm better off... 

prove yourself 
prove yourself 
prove yourself 

i want to breathe, i want to grow 
i'd say i want it but i don't know how 
i work, i bleed, i beg, i pray 

i'm better off dead 
i'm better off dead 
i'm better off... 

prove yourself 
prove yourself 
prove yourself 

i'm better off dead 
i'm better off dead 
i'm better off... 

prove yourself..

it's always best when the light is off
i am the pick in the ice
do not cry out or hit the alarm
you know we're friends till we die

and either way you turn
i'll be there
open up your skull
i'll be there
climbing up the walls

it's always best when the light is off
it's always better on the outside
fifteen blows to the back of your head
fifteen blows to your mind

so lock the kids up safe tonight
put the eyes in the cupboard
i've got the smell of a local man
who's got the loneliest feeling

that either way he turns
i'll be there
open up your skull
i'll be there

climbing up the walls
climbing up the walls
climbing up the walls
when you were here before
couldn't look you in the eye
you're just like an angel
your skin makes me cry

you float like a feather
in a beautiful world
and i wish i was special
you're so fuckin' special

but i'm a creep, i'm a weirdo.
what the hell am i doing here?
i don't belong here.

i don't care if it hurts
i want to have control
i want a perfect body
i want a perfect soul

i want you to notice
when i'm not around
you're so fuckin' special
i wish i was special

but i'm a creep, i'm a weirdo.
what the hell am i doing here?
i don't belong here.

she's running out again,
she's running out
she's run run run run

whatever makes you happy
whatever you want
you're so fuckin' special
i wish i was special

but i'm a creep, i'm a weirdo,
what the hell am i doing here?
i don't belong here.
i don't belong here.
i jumped in the river, what did i see?
black-eyed angels swam with me
a moon full of stars and astral cars
and all the figures i used to see
all my lovers were there with me
all my past and futures
and we all went to heaven in a little row boat
there was nothing to fear, nothing to doubt

a heart that's full up like a landfill
a job that slowly kills you
bruises that won't heal
you look so tired, unhappy
bring down the government
they don't, they don't speak for us
i'll take a quiet life
a handshake of carbon monoxide

with no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
silent, silent

this is my final fit
my final bellyache

with no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises

such a pretty house
and such a pretty garden

no alarms and no surprises

why don't you quiet down? (maybe i want to live in the children's land and you know maybe, maybe i)
why don't you quiet down? (maybe i'll wander the promised land i want peace and honesty)

my body is floating down the muddy river
once again i'm in trouble with my only friend
she is papering the window panes
she is putting on a smile
living in a glass house

once again packed like frozen food and battery hens
think of all the starving millions
don't talk politics and don't throw stones
your royal highness's

well of course i'd like to sit around and chat
well of course i'd like to stay and chew the fat
well of course i'd like to sit around and chat
but someone's listening in

once again we are hungry for a lynching
that's a strange mistake to make
you should turn the other cheek
living in a glass house

well of course i'd like to sit around and chat
well of course i'd like to stay and chew the fat
well of course i'd like to sit around and chat

i want to see you smile again
like diamonds in the dust
the amazing sound of the killing hordes
the day the banks collapse on us

cease this endless chattering
like everything is fine
when sorry is not good enough
sit in the back while no-one drives

you don't wanna talk to me,
you don't wanna say the words,
you try to get off the hook,

sprawling on a pin,
hanging off the hook,
trying to get yourself away,
trying to get yourself away.

there's no use dwelling on,
on what might have been,
just think of all the fun,
you could be having.

we know the way you talk,
we know what you want,
we know what you want,
what you really wanted.

take a look around,
there's candles on the cake,
on what might have been,
the road you should have took,
mistakes mistaken

there's no use dwelling on,
no use dwelling on.

it's such a beautiful day,
it's such a beautiful day,
find yourself a ????,
go and get some rest.

it wears her out

she lives with a broken man
a cracked polystyrene man
who just crumbles and burns

he used to do surgery
for girls in the eighties
but gravity always wins

and it wears him out
it wears him out
it wears him out

she looks like the real thing
she tastes like the real thing
my fake plastic love

but i can't help the feeling
i could blow through the ceiling
if i just turn and run

and it wears me out
it wears me out

these thoughts and the strain i am under
be a world child, form a circle

you do it everyday
you don't mean it but it hurts like hell

a lack of oxygen from my life support
my iron lung

we're too young to fall asleep
too cynical to speak
we are loosing it, can't you tell?

we scratch our eternal itch
our twentieth century bitch and we are grateful for our
iron lung

suck, suck your teenage thumb
toilet trained and dumb
when the power runs out we'll just hum

this this is our new song
just like the last one
a total waste of time

what if they don't get out of the way?
what if there's someone overtaking?

and it could be the last time you see me alive
there could be an idiot on the road
the only kick in life is pumping his steel

wrap me up in the back of the trunk
packed with foam and blind drunk
they won't ever take me alive
'cause they all drive

don't die on the motorway
the moon would freeze, the plants would die
i couldn't cope if you crashed today
all the things i forgot to say
i'm going out for a little drive

a green plastic watering can
for a fake chinese rubber plant
in the fake plastic earth

that she bought from a rubber man
in a town full of rubber plans
to get rid of itself

it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out

she lives with a broken man
a cracked polystyrene man
who just crumbles and burns

he used to do surgery
for girls in the eighties
but gravity always wins

and it wears him out
it wears him out
it wears him out
wears him out

she looks like the real thing
she tastes like the real thing
my fake plastic love

but i can't help the feeling
i could blow through the ceiling
if i just turn and run

and it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out

and if i could be who you wanted
if i could be who you wanted
all the time
all the time

how can you be smiling, saying
how can you be sure?

to drive your stupid car
it's funny how
'cause i never get that far

and you put my brain in overload
and i can't change gears
i cannot see the road

you got concrete eyes
and i cannot see your face
and i failed in life
'cause you crushed me with your hands

and you put my brain in overload
i can't change gears
i cannot see the road
when you were here before
couldn't look you in the eye
you're just like an angel
your skin makes me cry

you float like a feather
in a beautiful world
and i wish i was special
you're so fuckin' special

but i'm a creep, i'm a weirdo.
what the hell am i doing here?
i don't belong here.

i don't care if it hurts
i want to have control
i want a perfect body
i want a perfect soul

i want you to notice
when i'm not around
you're so fuckin' special
i wish i was special

but i'm a creep, i'm a weirdo.

what the hell am i doing here?
i don't belong here.

they dug me my very own garden
gave me sunshine

now you tie me up to your feather bed
and i twist and turn in a chinese burn
you won't let go

it won't let go

you're inside my head
inside my head

what did you put in that syringe?
whatever you really said to him?
is sitting there, inside of me

and you bother me
you possess me
you're there again
ahead of me
and i won't let go
i won't let go

you're inside my head
inside my head
inside my head
inside my head
i resent you calling
i resent your voice
i resent that i
don't have a choice

anywhere i go
you are always there
outside the car
or in my hair

i think i've been here before
yes i've been here before
the last time you locked
all the doors

and i resent you calling
i resent your voice
i resent that i
don't have a choice

and yes i am
yes i am

i think i've told you once
i think i needed advice
you were such a help
that's very nice

i think i've been here before
yes i've been here before
but this time i kick
down your door

yes i am
yes i am
been thinking about you, your records are here
your eyes are on my wall, your teeth are over there
but i'm still no one, and you're now a star
what do you care?
been thinking about you, and there's no rest
should i still love you, still see you in bed
but i'm playing with myself?
what do you care when the other men are far, far better?

all the things you got
all the things you need
who bought you cigarettes
who bribed the company to come and see you, honey

i've been thinking about you, so how can you sleep?
these people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet
they don't know what i know
why should you care when i'm not there?

been thinking about you, and there's no rest
should i still love you, still see you in bed
when i'm playing with myself?
what do you care when i'm not there?

all the things you got
that you'll never need
all the things you got
i'm played out and bleed to please you

been thinking about you
i never wanted anything like this 
i worked hard, tried hard 
i ran around in domestic bliss 
i fought hard, died long 
every time you're running out of here 
every time you're running i get the fear 

i never wanted any broken bones 
scarred face, no home 
your words surround me and asphyxiate 
and i burn all hate 

every time you're running out on me 
every time you're running i can see 

[chorus]
i'm not a vegetable 
i will not control myself 
i spit on the hand that feeds me 
i will not control myself 

the waters spray, the waters run all over me 
the waters spray, the waters run 
and this time you gonna pay 

[chorus]
killer cars
cars
killer cars

too hard on the brakes again
what if these brakes just give in?
what if they don't get out of the way?
what if there's someone overtaking?
i'm going out for a little drive
and it could be the last time you see me alive
there could be an idiot on the road
the only kick in life is pumping his steel

wrap me up in the back of the trunk
packed with foam and blind drunk
they won't ever take me alive
'cause they all drive

don't die on the motorway
the moon would freeze, the plants would die
i couldn't cope if you crashed today
all the things i forgot to say
i'm going out for a little drive
and it could be the last time you see me alive
what if the car loses control?
what if there's someone overtaking?

wrap me up in the back of the trunk
packed with foam and blind drunk
they won't ever take me alive
'cause they all drive

killer cars

wrap me up in the back of the trunk
packed with foam and blind drunk
no, they won't ever take me alive
'cause they all drive

killer cars

they all drive
killer cars
they all drive
killer cars

faith, you're driving me away
you do it everyday
you don't mean it but it hurts like hell

my brain says i'm receiving pain
a lack of oxygen from my life support
my iron lung

we're too young to fall asleep
too cynical to speak
we are loosing it, can't you tell?

we scratch our eternal itch
our twentieth century bitch and we are grateful for our
iron lung

suck, suck your teenage thumb
toilet trained and dumb
when the power runs out we'll just hum

this this is our new song
just like the last one
a total waste of time
my iron lung

black-eyed angels swam with me
a moon full of stars and astral cars

and we all went to heaven in a little row boat
there was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt

all the time
rows of houses, all bearing down on me
i can feel their blue hands touching me
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
and fade out again and fade out

this machine will, will not communicate
these thoughts and the strain i am under
be a world child, form a circle
before we all go under
and fade out again and fade out again

cracked eggs, dead birds
scream as they fight for life
i can feel death, can see its beady eyes
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
fade out again
fade out again

immerse your soul in love
immerse your soul in love
in the next world war
in a jack knifed juggernaut
i am born again

a green plastic watering can
for a fake chinese rubber plant
in the fake plastic earth
that she bought from a rubber man
in a town full of rubber plans
to get rid of itself

it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out

she lives with a broken man
a cracked polystyrene man
who just crumbles and burns
he used to do surgery
for girls in the eighties
but gravity always wins

and it wears him out
it wears him out
it wears him out
it wears

she looks like the real thing
she tastes like the real thing
my fake plastic love
but i can't help the feeling
i could blow through the ceiling
if i just turn and run

and it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out

and if i could be who you wanted
if i could be who you wanted
all the time
all the time

'cause i can't find the words 
and i can't find the song 

stop whispering, start shouting 
stop whispering, start shouting

"can't remember what it is

the smell of the warm summer air

i live in a town
where you can't smell a thing
you watch your feet
for cracks in the pavement

up above
aliens hover
making home movies
for the folks back home

of all these weird creatures
who lock up their spirits
drill holes in themselves
and live for their secrets

they're all
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight

oh

i wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
late at night when i'm driving
take me on board their beautiful ship
show me the world as i'd love to see it

i'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
they'd think that i'd finally lost it completely
i'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
they'd shut me away
but i'd be alright
alright
i'm alright
alright

i'm just
uptight
uptight

fitter, happier
more productive
comfortable
not drinking too much
regular exercise at the gym, three days a week
getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
at ease
eating well, no more microwave dinners and saturated fats
a patient, better driver
a safer car, baby smiling in back seat
sleeping well, no bad dreams
no paranoia
careful to all animals, never washing spiders down the plughole
keep in contact with old friends, enjoy a drink now and then
will frequently check credit at moral bank, hole in wall
favours for favours, fond but not in love
charity standing orders on sundays, ring-road supermarket
no killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
car wash, also on sundays
no longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows, nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
nothing so childish
at a better pace, slower and more calculated
no chance of escape
now self-employed
concerned, but powerless
an empowered and informed member of societ, pragmatism not idealism
will not cry in public
less chance of illness
tires that grip in the wet, shot of baby strapped in backseat
a good memory
still cries at a good film
still kisses with saliva
no longer empty and frantic

tied to a stick
that's driven into
frozen winter shit, the ability to laugh at weakness
calm, fitter, healthier and more productive
a pig in a cage on antibiotics

fitter, happier
more productive
comfortable
not drinking too much
regular exercise at the gym, three days a week
getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
at ease
eating well, no more microwave dinners and saturated fats
a patient, better driver
a safer car, baby smiling in back seat
sleeping well, no bad dreams
no paranoia
careful to all animals, never washing spiders down the plughole
keep in contact with old friends, enjoy a drink now and then
will frequently check credit at moral bank, hole in wall
favours for favours, fond but not in love
charity standing orders on sundays, ring-road supermarket
no killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
car wash, also on sundays
no longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows, nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
nothing so childish
at a better pace, slower and more calculated
no chance of escape
now self-employed
concerned, but powerless
an empowered and informed member of societ, pragmatism not idealism
will not cry in public
less chance of illness
tires that grip in the wet, shot of baby strapped in backseat
a good memory
still cries at a good film
still kisses with saliva
no longer empty and frantic
like a cat
tied to a stick
that's driven into
frozen winter shit, the ability to laugh at weakness
calm, fitter, healthier and more productive
a pig in a cage on antibiotics

getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
at ease
eating well, no more microwave dinners and saturated fats
a patient, better driver
a safer car, baby smiling in back seat
sleeping well, no bad dreams
no paranoia
careful to all animals, never washing spiders down the plughole
keep in contact with old friends, enjoy a drink now and then
will frequently check credit at moral bank, hole in wall
favours for favours, fond but not in love
charity standing orders on sundays, ring-road supermarket
no killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
car wash, also on sundays
no longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows, nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
nothing so childish
at a better pace, slower and more calculated
no chance of escape
now self-employed
concerned, but powerless
an empowered and informed member of societ, pragmatism not idealism
will not cry in public
less chance of illness
tires that grip in the wet, shot of baby strapped in backseat
a good memory
still cries at a good film
still kisses with saliva
no longer empty and frantic
like a cat
tied to a stick
that's driven into
frozen winter shit, the ability to laugh at weakness
calm, fitter, healthier and more productive
a pig in a cage on antibiotics

you know we're friends till we die

and either way you turn
i'll be there
open up your skull
i'll be there
climbing up the walls

it's always best when the light is off

fifteen blows to the back of your head
fifteen blows to your mind

so lock the kids up safe tonight
shut the eyes in the cupboard
i've got the smell of a local man
who's got the loneliest feeling

i'll be there
open up your skull
i'll be there

climbing up the walls

a handshake of carbon monoxide

the breath of the morning
i keep forgetting
the smell of the warm summer air

i live in a town
where you can't smell a thing
you watch your feet
for cracks in the pavement

up above
aliens hover
making home movies
for the folks back home

of all these weird creatures
who lock up their spirits
drill holes in themselves
and live for their secrets

they're all
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight

oh

i wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
late at night when i'm driving
take me on board their beautiful ship
show me the world as i'd love to see it

i'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
they'd think that i'd finally lost it completely
i'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
they'd shut me away
but i'd be alright
alright
i'm alright

fitter, happier
more productive
comfortable
not drinking too much
regular exercise at the gym, three days a week
getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
at ease
eating well, no more microwave dinners and saturated fats
a patient, better driver
a safer car, baby smiling in back seat
sleeping well, no bad dreams
no paranoia
careful to all animals, never washing spiders down the plughole
keep in contact with old friends, enjoy a drink now and then
will frequently check credit at moral bank, hole in wall
favours for favours, fond but not in love
charity standing orders on sundays, ring-road supermarket
no killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
car wash, also on sundays
no longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows, nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
nothing so childish
at a better pace, slower and more calculated
no chance of escape
now self-employed
concerned, but powerless
an empowered and informed member of societ, pragmatism not idealism
will not cry in public
less chance of illness
tires that grip in the wet, shot of baby strapped in backseat
a good memory
still cries at a good film
still kisses with saliva
no longer empty and frantic
like a cat
tied to a stick
that's driven into
frozen winter shit, the ability to laugh at weakness
calm, fitter, healthier and more productive
a pig in a cage on antibiotics

i keep forgetting
the smell of the warm summer air

i live in a town
where you can't smell a thing
you watch your feet
for cracks in the pavement

up above
aliens hover
making home movies
for the folks back home

of all these weird creatures
who lock up their spirits
drill holes in themselves
and live for their secrets

they're all
uptight
uptight

late at night when i'm driving
take me on board their beautiful ship
show me the world as i'd love to see it

i'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
they'd think that i'd finally lost it completely
i'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
they'd shut me away
but i'd be alright
alright
i'm alright
alright

i'm just
uptight

flying on your motorcycle
watching all the ground beneath you drop

you broke another mirror

don't leave me dry
don't leave me high

drying up in conversation
you will be the one who cannot talk
all your insides fall to pieces
you just sit there wishing you could still make love

they're the ones who'll hate you
when you think you've got the world all sussed out
they're the once who'll spit at you
you'll be the one screaming out

you can force it but it will not come
you can taste it but it will not form
you can crush it but it's always here
you can crush it but it's always near
chasing you home

saying, everything is broken
everyone is broken

you can force it but it will stay stung
you can crush it as dry as a bone
you can walk it home straight from school
you can kiss, you can break all the rules

but still, everything is broken
everyone is broken
everyone is, everyone is broken
everyone is, everything is broken

wears him out

she looks like the real thing
she tastes like the real thing
my fake plastic love

now i can't climb the stairs
pieces missing everywhere
prozak painkillers
when you've got to feel it in your bones
when you've got to feel it in your bones

all the children flew when i touched their hands
you see, you've got to feel it in your bones

my brain says i'm receiving pain
a lack of oxygen from my life support
my iron lung

we're too young to fall asleep
too cynical to speak
we are loosing it, can't you tell?

we scratch our eternal itch
our twentieth century bitch and we are grateful for our
iron lung

suck, suck your teenage thumb
toilet trained and dumb
when the power runs out we'll just hum

this this is our new song
just like the last one
a total waste of time

blame it on the satellite that beams me home

i get on the train and i just stand about now that i don't think of you
i keep falling over i keep passing out when i see a face like you
what am i coming to?
i'm gonna melt down

sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
god rest your soul
when the loving comes and we've already gone
just like your dad, you'll never change

each time it comes it eats me alive
i try to behave but it eats me alive

packed with foam and blind drunk
they won't ever take me alive
'cause they all drive

don't die on the motorway

can't get the stink off
he's been hanging around for days
comes like a comet
suckered you but not your friends

one day he'll get to you
and teach you how to be a holy cow

you do it to yourself, you do
and that's what really hurts
is you do it to yourself, just you
you and no-one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself

don't get my sympathy, hanging out the fifteenth floor
you've changed the locks three times
he still comes reeling through the door

you can force it but it will not come
you can taste it but it will not form
you can crush it but it's always here
you can crush it but it's always near
chasing you home

saying, everything is broken
everyone is broken

you can force it but it will stay stung
you can crush it as dry as a bone
you can walk it home straight from school
you can kiss, you can break all the rules

but still, everything is broken
everyone is broken
everyone is, everyone is broken
everyone is, everything is broken

why can't you forget?
why can't you forget?

killer cars ... cars
killer cars

too hard on the brakes again
what if these brakes just give in?
what if they don't get outta the way?
what if there's someone overtaking?

i'm going out for a little drive, and it could be the last time you see me alive
there could be an idiot on the road
the only kick in life is pumping that steel

wrap me up in the back of the trunk, packed with foam and blind drunk
they won't ever take me alive
'cause they all drive ...

don't die on the motorway
the moon would freeze, the plants would die
i couldn't cope if you crashed today
all the things i forgot to say

i'm going out for a little drive, and it could be the last time you see me alive
what if that car loses control?
what if there's someone overtaking?

wrap me up in the back of the trunk, packed with foam and blind drunk
they won't ever take me alive
'cause they all drive ...

and you put my brain in overload
and i can't change gears
i cannot see the road
you got concrete eyes

where are you now?
when i need you
alone on an airplane
falling asleep against the windowpane
my blood will thicken

i need to wash myself again
to hide all the dirt and pain
'cause i'd be scared
that there's nothing underneath
and who are my real friends
have they all got the bends?
am i really sinking
this slow

my baby's got the bends
oh, no
we don't have any real friends
no, no, no

just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
and i wish it was the sixties, i wish i could be happy
i wish, i wish, i wish that something would happen

where do we go from here?
the planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
and where are you?

they brought in the c.i.a
the tanks and the whole marines to blow me away
to blow me sky-high

baby's got the bends
we don't have any real friends

just lying in a bar with my drip feed on

two jumps in a week
i bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you boy?
flying on your motorcycle
watching all the ground beneath you drop

kill yourself for recognition
kill yourself to never ever stop
you broke another mirror
you're turning into something you are not

don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry

drying up in conversation
you will be the one who cannot talk
all your insides fall to pieces
you just sit there wishing you could still make love

they're the ones who'll hate you
when you think you've got the world all sussed out
they're the once who'll spit at you
you'll be the one screaming out

don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry

oh, it's the best thing that you ever had
the best thing you ever, ever had
it's the best thing that you ever had
the best thing you have had is gone away

d-don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry

a green plastic watering can
for a fake chinese rubber plant
in the fake plastic earth

that she bought from a rubber man
in a town full of rubber plans
to get rid of itself

it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out

she lives with a broken man
a cracked polystyrene man
who just crumbles and burns

he used to do surgery
for girls in the eighties
but gravity always wins

and it wears him out
it wears him out
it wears him out
wears him out

she looks like the real thing
she tastes like the real thing
my fake plastic love

but i can't help the feeling
i could blow through the ceiling
if i just turn and run

and it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out

and if i could be who you wanted
if i could be who you wanted
all the time
all the time
i don't want to be crippled and cracked

you don't mean it but it hurts like hell

my brain says i'm receiving pain
a lack of oxygen from my life support
my iron lung

we're too young to fall asleep
too cynical to speak
we are loosing it, can't you tell?

we scratch our eternal itch
our twentieth century bitch and we are grateful for our
iron lung

suck, suck your teenage thumb
toilet trained and dumb
when the power runs out we'll just hum

this this is our new song
just like the last one
a total waste of time
my iron lung

you can be frightened
you can be, it's okay

well what am i to do?
i know all the things around your head and what they do to you
what are we coming to?

the troubled words of a troubled mind i try to understand what is eating you
i try to stay awake but its 58 hours since that i last slept with you

you bite through the big wall, the big wall bites back
you just sit there and sulk, sit there and bawl
you are so pretty when you're on your knees
disinfected, eager to please

sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
god rest your soul
when the loving comes and we've already gone
just like your dad, you'll never change

each time it comes it eats me alive
i try to behave but it eats me alive
so i declare a holiday
fall asleep, drift away

sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
god rest your soul
when the loving comes and we've already gone
just like your dad, you'll never change

rows of houses, all bearing down on me
i can feel their blue hands touching me
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
and fade out again and fade out

this machine will, will not communicate
these thoughts and the strain i am under
be a world child, form a circle
before we all go under
and fade out again and fade out again

cracked eggs, dead birds
scream as they fight for life
i can feel death, can see its beady eyes
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
fade out again
fade out again

immerse your soul in love
immerse your soul in love

seen all good things and bad
running down the hill
all so
battered and brought to the ground
i am hungry again
i am drunk again
with all the money i owe to my friends

when i'm like this
how can you be smiling, saying
how can you be sure?
how can you be sure?

if you walk out the door
will i see you again?
if so much of me lies in your eyes
i am hungry again
i am drunk again

killer cars
cars
killer cars

too hard on the brakes again
what if these brakes just give in?
what if they don't get out of the way?
what if there's someone overtaking?
i'm going out for a little drive
and it could be the last time you see me alive
there could be an idiot on the road
the only kick in life is pumping his steel

wrap me up in the back of the trunk
packed with foam and blind drunk
they won't ever take me alive
'cause they all drive

two jumps in a week
i bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you boy?
flying on your motorcycle
watching all the ground beneath you drop

kill yourself for recognition
kill yourself to never ever stop
you broke another mirror
you're turning into something you are not

don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry

drying up in conversation
you will be the one who cannot talk
all your insides fall to pieces
you just sit there wishing you could still make love

they're the ones who'll hate you
when you think you've got the world all sussed out
they're the once who'll spit at you
you'll be the one screaming out

don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry

oh, it's the best thing that you ever had

a green plastic watering can
for a fake chinese rubber plant
in the fake plastic earth

that she bought from a rubber man
in a town full of rubber plans
to get rid of itself

it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out

she lives with a broken man
a cracked polystyrene man
who just crumbles and burns

he used to do surgery
for girls in the eighties
but gravity always wins

and it wears him out
it wears him out
it wears him out
wears him out

she looks like the real thing
she tastes like the real thing
my fake plastic love

but i can't help the feeling
i could blow through the ceiling
if i just turn and run

and it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out

and if i could be who you wanted
if i could be who you wanted
all the time
all the time
i don't want to be crippled and cracked
shoulders and wrists, knees and back
ground to dust and ash
crawling on all fours
when you've got to feel it in your bones
when you've got to feel it in your bones
now i can't climb the stairs
pieces missing everywhere
prozak painkillers
when you've got to feel it in your bones
when you've got to feel it in your bones
i used to fly like peter pan
all the children flew when i touched their hands
you see, you've got to feel it in your bones
you see, you've got to feel it in your bones
ah-ah
they love me like i was their brother
they protect me
listen to me
they dug me my very own garden
gave me sunshine
made me happy
nice dream
nice dream
nice dream

i call up my friend the good angel
but she's out with
her answer-phone
she says she'd love to come help but
the sea would
electrocute us all
nice dream
nice dream

can't get the stink off
he's been hanging around for days
comes like a comet
suckered you but not your friends

one day he'll get to you
and teach you how to be a holy cow

you do it to yourself, you do
and that's what really hurts
is you do it to yourself, just you
you and no-one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself

don't get my sympathy, hanging out the fifteenth floor
you've changed the locks three times
he still comes reeling through the door
one day i'll get to you
and teach you how to get to purest hell

you do it to yourself you do
and that's what really hurts
is you do it to yourself, just you
you and no-one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself

you do it to yourself you do
and that's what really hurts

you do it to yourself, whoa

say, hey

you do it to yourself, you do it to yourself
yeah, yeah, you do it to yourself, yes-yes, you
do it to yourself
faith, you're driving me away
you do it everyday
you don't mean it but it hurts like hell

my brain says i'm receiving pain
a lack of oxygen from my life support
my iron lung

we're too young to fall asleep
too cynical to speak
we are loosing it, can't you tell?

we scratch our eternal itch
our twentieth century bitch and we are grateful for our
iron lung

suck, suck your teenage thumb
toilet trained and dumb
when the power runs out we'll just hum

this this is our new song
just like the last one
a total waste of time
my iron lung

if you're frightened
you can be frightened
you can be, it's okay 

if you're frightened
you can be frightened
you can be, it's okay
limb by limb and tooth by tooth
tearing up inside of me
every day every hour
i wish that i was bullet proof

wax me
mould me
heat the pins and stab them in
you have turned me into this
just wish that it was bullet proof

so pay the money and take a shot
leadfill the hole in me
i could burst a million bubbles
all surrogate and bullet proof

and bullet proof
and bullet proof

i get home from work and you're still standing in your dressing gown
well what am i to do?
i know all the things around your head and what they do to you
what are we coming to?
what are we gonna do?

blame it on the black star
blame it on the falling sky
blame it on the satellite that beams me home

the troubled words of a troubled mind i try to understand what is eating you
i try to stay awake but its 58 hours since that i last slept with you
what are we coming to?
i just don't know anymore

blame it on the black star
blame it on the falling sky
blame it on the satellite that beams me home

i get on the train and i just stand about now that i don't think of you
i keep falling over i keep passing out when i see a face like you
what am i coming to?
i'm gonna melt down

blame it on the black star
blame it on the falling sky
blame it on the satellite that beams me home
this is killing me
this is killing me
you bite through the big wall, the big wall bites back
you just sit there and sulk, sit there and bawl
you are so pretty when you're on your knees
disinfected, eager to please

sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
god rest your soul
when the loving comes and we've already gone
just like your dad, you'll never change

each time it comes it eats me alive
i try to behave but it eats me alive
so i declare a holiday
fall asleep, drift away

sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
god rest your soul
when the loving comes and we've already gone
just like your dad, you'll never change

sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn

rows of houses, all bearing down on me
i can feel their blue hands touching me
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
and fade out again and fade out

this machine will, will not communicate
these thoughts and the strain i am under
be a world child, form a circle
before we all go under
and fade out again and fade out again

cracked eggs, dead birds
scream as they fight for life
i can feel death, can see its beady eyes
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
fade out again
fade out again

immerse your soul in love
immerse your soul in love

too hard on the brakes again
what if these brakes just give in?
what if they don't get out of the way?
what if there's someone overtaking?
i'm going out for a little drive
and it could be the last time you see me alive
there could be an idiot on the road
the only kick in life is pumping his steel

wrap me up in the back of the trunk
packed with foam and blind drunk
they won't ever take me alive
'cause they all drive

don't die on the motorway
the moon would freeze, the plants would die
i couldn't cope if you crashed today
all the things i forgot to say
i'm going out for a little drive
and it could be the last time you see me alive
what if the car loses control?
what if there's someone overtaking?

wrap me up in the back of the trunk
packed with foam and blind drunk
they won't ever take me alive
'cause they all drive

a green plastic watering can
for a fake chinese rubber plant
in the fake plastic earth

that she bought from a rubber man
in a town full of rubber plans
to get rid of itself

it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out

she lives with a broken man
a cracked polystyrene man
who just crumbles and burns

he used to do surgery
for girls in the eighties
but gravity always wins

and it wears him out
it wears him out
it wears him out
wears him out

she looks like the real thing
she tastes like the real thing
my fake plastic love

but i can't help the feeling
i could blow through the ceiling
if i just turn and run

and it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out

and if i could be who you wanted
if i could be who you wanted
all the time

i don't want to be crippled and cracked
shoulders and wrists, knees and back
ground to dust and ash
crawling on all fours
when you've got to feel it in your bones
when you've got to feel it in your bones
now i can't climb the stairs
pieces missing everywhere
prozak painkillers
when you've got to feel it in your bones
when you've got to feel it in your bones
i used to fly like peter pan
all the children flew when i touched their hands
you see, you've got to feel it in your bones
you see, you've got to feel it in your bones
ah-ah
they love me like i was their brother
they protect me
listen to me
they dug me my very own garden
gave me sunshine
made me happy
nice dream
nice dream
nice dream

i call up my friend the good angel
but she's out with
her answer-phone
she says she'd love to come help but
the sea would
electrocute us all
nice dream
nice dream
nice dream
nice dream

nice dream

nice dream, if you think that you're strong enough
nice dream, if you think you belong enough
nice dream, if you think that you're strong enough

killer cars

too hard on the brakes again
what if these brakes just give in?
what if they don't get out of the way?
what if there's someone overtaking?
i'm going out for a little drive
and it could be the last time you see me alive
there could be an idiot on the road
the only kick in life is pumping his steel

wrap me up in the back of the trunk
packed with foam and blind drunk
they won't ever take me alive
'cause they all drive

don't die on the motorway
the moon would freeze, the plants would die
i couldn't cope if you crashed today
all the things i forgot to say
i'm going out for a little drive
and it could be the last time you see me alive
what if the car loses control?
what if there's someone overtaking?

wrap me up in the back of the trunk
packed with foam and blind drunk
they won't ever take me alive
'cause they all drive

killer cars

when you think you've got the world all sussed out
they're the once who'll spit at you
you'll be the one screaming out

don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high

oh, it's the best thing that you ever had
the best thing you ever, ever had

you can force it but it will not come
you can taste it but it will not form
you can crush it but it's always here
you can crush it but it's always near
chasing you home

saying, everything is broken
everyone is broken

you can force it but it will stay stung
you can crush it as dry as a bone
you can walk it home straight from school
you can kiss, you can break all the rules

but still, everything is broken
everyone is broken
everyone is, everyone is broken
everyone is, everything is broken

when i need you
alone on an airplane
falling asleep against the windowpane
my blood will thicken

i need to wash myself again
to hide all the dirt and pain
'cause i'd be scared

where do we go from here?
the planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear

two jumps in a week
i bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you boy?
flying on your motorcycle
watching all the ground beneath you drop

kill yourself for recognition
kill yourself to never ever stop
you broke another mirror
you're turning into something you are not

don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high

a green plastic watering can
for a fake chinese rubber plant
in the fake plastic earth

that she bought from a rubber man
in a town full of rubber plans
to get rid of itself

it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out

she lives with a broken man
a cracked polystyrene man
who just crumbles and burns

he used to do surgery
for girls in the eighties
but gravity always wins

and it wears him out
it wears him out
it wears him out
wears him out

she looks like the real thing
she tastes like the real thing
my fake plastic love

but i can't help the feeling
i could blow through the ceiling
if i just turn and run

and it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out

and if i could be who you wanted
if i could be who you wanted
all the time
all the time
i don't want to be crippled and cracked
shoulders and wrists, knees and back
ground to dust and ash
crawling on all fours
when you've got to feel it in your bones
when you've got to feel it in your bones
now i can't climb the stairs
pieces missing everywhere
prozak painkillers
when you've got to feel it in your bones
when you've got to feel it in your bones
i used to fly like peter pan
all the children flew when i touched their hands
you see, you've got to feel it in your bones
you see, you've got to feel it in your bones
ah-ah
they love me like i was their brother
they protect me
listen to me
they dug me my very own garden
gave me sunshine
made me happy
nice dream

can't get the stink off
he's been hanging around for days
comes like a comet
suckered you but not your friends

one day he'll get to you
and teach you how to be a holy cow

you do it to yourself, you do
and that's what really hurts
is you do it to yourself, just you
you and no-one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself

don't get my sympathy, hanging out the fifteenth floor
you've changed the locks three times
he still comes reeling through the door
one day i'll get to you
and teach you how to get to purest hell

you do it to yourself you do
and that's what really hurts

you and no-one else

faith, you're driving me away
you do it everyday
you don't mean it but it hurts like hell

my brain says i'm receiving pain
a lack of oxygen from my life support
my iron lung

we're too young to fall asleep
too cynical to speak
we are loosing it, can't you tell?

we scratch our eternal itch
our twentieth century bitch and we are grateful for our
iron lung

suck, suck your teenage thumb
toilet trained and dumb
when the power runs out we'll just hum

this this is our new song
just like the last one
a total waste of time
my iron lung

you can be frightened
you can be, it's okay

limb by limb and tooth by tooth
tearing up inside of me
every day every hour
i wish that i was bullet proof

wax me
mould me
heat the pins and stab them in
you have turned me into this
just wish that it was bullet proof

so pay the money and take a shot
leadfill the hole in me
i could burst a million bubbles
all surrogate and bullet proof

and bullet proof
and bullet proof
and bullet proof
i get home from work and you're still standing in your dressing gown
well what am i to do?
i know all the things around your head and what they do to you
what are we coming to?
what are we gonna do?

blame it on the black star
blame it on the falling sky
blame it on the satellite that beams me home

the troubled words of a troubled mind i try to understand what is eating you
i try to stay awake but its 58 hours since that i last slept with you
what are we coming to?
i just don't know anymore

blame it on the black star
blame it on the falling sky
blame it on the satellite that beams me home

i get on the train and i just stand about now that i don't think of you
i keep falling over i keep passing out when i see a face like you
what am i coming to?
i'm gonna melt down

blame it on the black star
blame it on the falling sky
blame it on the satellite that beams me home
this is killing me
this is killing me
you bite through the big wall, the big wall bites back
you just sit there and sulk, sit there and bawl
you are so pretty when you're on your knees
disinfected, eager to please

sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
god rest your soul
when the loving comes and we've already gone
just like your dad, you'll never change

each time it comes it eats me alive
i try to behave but it eats me alive
so i declare a holiday
fall asleep, drift away

sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
god rest your soul
when the loving comes and we've already gone
just like your dad, you'll never change

rows of houses, all bearing down on me
i can feel their blue hands touching me
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
and fade out again and fade out

this machine will, will not communicate
these thoughts and the strain i am under
be a world child, form a circle
before we all go under
and fade out again and fade out again

cracked eggs, dead birds
scream as they fight for life
i can feel death, can see its beady eyes
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
fade out again
fade out again

immerse your soul in love
immerse your soul in love
seen all good things and bad
running down the hill
all so
battered and brought to the ground
i am hungry again
i am drunk again
with all the money i owe to my friends

when i'm like this
how can you be smiling, saying
how can you be sure?
how can you be sure?

if you walk out the door
will i see you again?
if so much of me lies in your eyes
i am hungry again
i am drunk again
with all the money i owe to my friends

when i'm like this
how can you be smiling, saying
how can you be sure? (i don't want you anymore)
how can you be sure? (i don't want you anymore)
how can you be sure? (i don't want you anymore)

killer cars
cars
killer cars

too hard on the brakes again
what if these brakes just give in?
what if they don't get out of the way?
what if there's someone overtaking?
i'm going out for a little drive
and it could be the last time you see me alive
there could be an idiot on the road
the only kick in life is pumping his steel

wrap me up in the back of the trunk
packed with foam and blind drunk
they won't ever take me alive
'cause they all drive

don't die on the motorway
the moon would freeze, the plants would die
i couldn't cope if you crashed today
all the things i forgot to say
i'm going out for a little drive
and it could be the last time you see me alive
what if the car loses control?
what if there's someone overtaking?

wrap me up in the back of the trunk
packed with foam and blind drunk
they won't ever take me alive
'cause they all drive

killer cars

suck, suck your teenage thumb
toilet trained and dumb
when the power runs out we'll just hum

this this is our new song
just like the last one
a total waste of time
my iron lung

i wrapped you inside my coat 
when they came to firebomb the house 
i didn't feel pain, 'cause no-one can touch me 
now that i'm held in your spell 

a beautiful girl 
a beautiful girl 
can turn your world into dust 

sell me a car that goes

i am gone
everybody's raging
and these fruits
they still taste of poison
i won't be around
when you really need me

i can't sleep
why can't someone hold me
i need warmth
a restless body cracks some more
i won't have the strength
when you really need me
i must get out once in a while
everything is starting to die
the dust settles, the worms dig
spiders crawl over the bed

i must get out once in a while
i eat all day and now i'm fat
yesterday's meal is hugging the plate
you never wash up after yourself
when you were here before
couldn't look you in the eye
you're just like an angel
your skin makes me cry

you float like a feather
in a beautiful world
and i wish i was special
you're so fuckin' special

but i'm a creep, i'm a weirdo.
what the hell am i doing here?
i don't belong here.

i don't care if it hurts

was always waiting for the crush
the car to drive right through the shops
to call in sick and late at work
and take a holiday..

was always tangled up in knots
to keep myself from speaking up
but no-one's listening anyway
just trying to bribe me..

and if it's alright, then what am i doing here?
and if it's alright, this place is gassed by fear
and if it's alright, i'll tell you, 'cause you never understand
and if it's alright, i'll beg you, 'cause i'm a begging kind of man

today i wrote a bad check
packed a bag and took a jet
but no-one's looking anyway
i hope they miss me

i just think maybe i'm making a mistake.
i resent you calling
i resent your voice
i resent that i
don't have a choice

anywhere i go
you are always there
outside the car
or in my hair

i think i've been here before
yes i've been here before
the last time you locked
all the doors

and i resent you calling
i resent your voice
i resent that i
don't have a choice

and yes i am
yes i am

i think i've told you once
i think i needed advice
you were such a help
that's very nice

i think i've been here before
yes i've been here before
but this time i kick
down your door

yes i am
yes i am

just trying to bribe me..

and if it's alright, then what am i doing here?
and if it's alright, this place is gassed by fear
and if it's alright, i'll tell you, 'cause you never understand
and if it's alright, i'll beg you, 'cause i'm a begging kind of man

today i wrote a bad check
packed a bag and took a jet
but no-one's looking anyway
i hope they miss me

i just think maybe i'm making a mistake.

you can force it but it will not come
you can taste it but it will not form
you can crush it but it's always here
you can crush it but it's always near
chasing you home

saying, everything is broken
everyone is broken

you can force it but it will stay stung
you can crush it as dry as a bone
you can walk it home straight from school
you can kiss, you can break all the rules

but still, everything is broken
everyone is broken
everyone is, everyone is broken
everyone is, everything is broken

where do we go from here?
the words are coming out all weird
where are you now?
when i need you
alone on an airplane
falling asleep against the windowpane
my blood will thicken

i need to wash myself again
to hide all the dirt and pain
'cause i'd be scared
that there's nothing underneath
and who are my real friends
have they all got the bends?
am i really sinking
this slow

my baby's got the bends
oh, no
we don't have any real friends
no, no, no

just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
and i wish it was the sixties, i wish i could be happy
i wish, i wish, i wish that something would happen

where do we go from here?
the planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
and where are you?

they brought in the c.i.a
the tanks and the whole marines to blow me away
to blow me sky-high

baby's got the bends
we don't have any real friends

just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
i wish it was the sixties, i wish i could be happy
i wish, i wish, i wish that something would-

i want to live, breathe
i want to be part of the human race

two jumps in a week
i bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you boy?
flying on your motorcycle
watching all the ground beneath you drop

kill yourself for recognition
kill yourself to never ever stop
you broke another mirror
you're turning into something you are not

don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry

drying up in conversation
you will be the one who cannot talk
all your insides fall to pieces
you just sit there wishing you could still make love

they're the ones who'll hate you
when you think you've got the world all sussed out
they're the once who'll spit at you
you'll be the one screaming out

don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry

oh, it's the best thing that you ever had
the best thing you ever, ever had
it's the best thing that you ever had
the best thing you have had is gone away

d-don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry

a green plastic watering can
for a fake chinese rubber plant
in the fake plastic earth

that she bought from a rubber man
in a town full of rubber plans
to get rid of itself

it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out

she lives with a broken man
a cracked polystyrene man
who just crumbles and burns

he used to do surgery
for girls in the eighties
but gravity always wins

and it wears him out
it wears him out
it wears him out
wears him out

she looks like the real thing
she tastes like the real thing
my fake plastic love

but i can't help the feeling
i could blow through the ceiling
if i just turn and run

and it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out

and if i could be who you wanted
if i could be who you wanted
all the time
all the time
i don't want to be crippled and cracked
shoulders and wrists, knees and back
ground to dust and ash
crawling on all fours
when you've got to feel it in your bones
when you've got to feel it in your bones
now i can't climb the stairs
pieces missing everywhere
prozak painkillers
when you've got to feel it in your bones
when you've got to feel it in your bones
i used to fly like peter pan
all the children flew when i touched their hands
you see, you've got to feel it in your bones
you see, you've got to feel it in your bones
ah-ah
can't get the stink off
he's been hanging around for days
comes like a comet
suckered you but not your friends

one day he'll get to you
and teach you how to be a holy cow

you do it to yourself, you do
and that's what really hurts
is you do it to yourself, just you
you and no-one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself

don't get my sympathy, hanging out the fifteenth floor
you've changed the locks three times
he still comes reeling through the door
one day i'll get to you
and teach you how to get to purest hell

you do it to yourself you do
and that's what really hurts
is you do it to yourself, just you
you and no-one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself

you do it to yourself you do
and that's what really hurts
is you do it to yourself just you
you and no-one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself, whoa

say, hey

you do it to yourself, you do it to yourself
yeah, yeah, you do it to yourself, yes-yes, you
do it to yourself
faith, you're driving me away
you do it everyday
you don't mean it but it hurts like hell

my brain says i'm receiving pain
a lack of oxygen from my life support
my iron lung

we're too young to fall asleep
too cynical to speak
we are loosing it, can't you tell?

we scratch our eternal itch
our twentieth century bitch and we are grateful for our
iron lung

suck, suck your teenage thumb
toilet trained and dumb
when the power runs out we'll just hum

this this is our new song
just like the last one
a total waste of time
my iron lung

if you're frightened
you can be frightened
you can be, it's okay 

if you're frightened
you can be frightened
you can be, it's okay
limb by limb and tooth by tooth
tearing up inside of me
every day every hour
i wish that i was bullet proof

wax me
mould me
heat the pins and stab them in
you have turned me into this
just wish that it was bullet proof

so pay the money and take a shot
leadfill the hole in me
i could burst a million bubbles
all surrogate and bullet proof

and bullet proof
and bullet proof
and bullet proof
i get home from work and you're still standing in your dressing gown
well what am i to do?
i know all the things around your head and what they do to you
what are we coming to?
what are we gonna do?

blame it on the black star
blame it on the falling sky
blame it on the satellite that beams me home

the troubled words of a troubled mind i try to understand what is eating you
i try to stay awake but its 58 hours since that i last slept with you
what are we coming to?
i just don't know anymore

blame it on the black star
blame it on the falling sky
blame it on the satellite that beams me home

i get on the train and i just stand about now that i don't think of you
i keep falling over i keep passing out when i see a face like you
what am i coming to?
i'm gonna melt down

blame it on the black star
blame it on the falling sky
blame it on the satellite that beams me home
this is killing me
this is killing me
you bite through the big wall, the big wall bites back
you just sit there and sulk, sit there and bawl
you are so pretty when you're on your knees
disinfected, eager to please

sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
god rest your soul
when the loving comes and we've already gone
just like your dad, you'll never change

each time it comes it eats me alive
i try to behave but it eats me alive
so i declare a holiday
fall asleep, drift away

sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
god rest your soul
when the loving comes and we've already gone
just like your dad, you'll never change

sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
god rest your soul
when the loving comes and we've already gone
just like your dad, you'll never change
rows of houses, all bearing down on me
i can feel their blue hands touching me
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
and fade out again and fade out

this machine will, will not communicate
these thoughts and the strain i am under
be a world child, form a circle
before we all go under
and fade out again and fade out again

cracked eggs, dead birds
scream as they fight for life
i can feel death, can see its beady eyes
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
fade out again
fade out again

immerse your soul in love
immerse your soul in love
in the next world war
in a jack knifed juggernaut
i am born again

in the neon sign
scrolling up and down
i am born again

in an interstellar burst
i am back to save the universe

in a deep, deep sleep
of the innocent
i am born again

in a fast german car
i'm amazed that i survived
an airbag saved my life

in an interstellar burst
i am back to save the universe

in an interstellar burst
i am back to save the universe

in an interstellar burst
i am back to save the universe
please could you stop the noise
i'm trying to get some rest
from all the unborn chicken voices in my head
what's that?
what's that?

when i am king, you will be first against the wall
with your opinion which is of no consequence at all
what's that?
what's that?

ambition makes you look pretty ugly
kicking, squealing gucci little piggy

the breath of the morning
i keep forgetting
the smell of the warm summer air

i live in a town
where you can't smell a thing
you watch your feet
for cracks in the pavement

up above
aliens hover
making home movies
for the folks back home

of all these weird creatures
who lock up their spirits
drill holes in themselves
and live for their secrets

they're all
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight

oh

i wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
late at night when i'm driving
take me on board their beautiful ship
show me the world as i'd love to see it

i'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
they'd think that i'd finally lost it completely
i'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
they'd shut me away
but i'd be alright
alright
i'm alright
alright

i'm just
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight

transport, motorways and tramlines
starting and then stopping
taking off and landing
the emptiest of feelings
disappointed people, clinging on to bottles
when it comes it's so, so, disappointing

let down and hanging around
crushed like a bug in the ground
let down and hanging around

shell smashed, juices flowing
wings twitch, legs are going
don't get sentimental, it always ends up drivel
one day, i am gonna grow wings
a chemical reaction
hysterical and useless
hysterical and

fitter, happier
more productive
comfortable
not drinking too much
regular exercise at the gym, three days a week
getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
at ease
eating well, no more microwave dinners and saturated fats
a patient, better driver
a safer car, baby smiling in back seat
sleeping well, no bad dreams
no paranoia
careful to all animals, never washing spiders down the plughole
keep in contact with old friends, enjoy a drink now and then
will frequently check credit at moral bank, hole in wall
favours for favours, fond but not in love
charity standing orders on sundays, ring-road supermarket
no killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
car wash, also on sundays
no longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows, nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
nothing so childish
at a better pace, slower and more calculated
no chance of escape
now self-employed
concerned, but powerless
an empowered and informed member of societ, pragmatism not idealism
will not cry in public
less chance of illness
tires that grip in the wet, shot of baby strapped in backseat
a good memory
still cries at a good film
still kisses with saliva
no longer empty and frantic
like a cat
tied to a stick
that's driven into
frozen winter shit, the ability to laugh at weakness
calm, fitter, healthier and more productive
a pig in a cage on antibiotics

that either way he turns
i'll be there
open up your skull
i'll be there

climbing up the walls
climbing up the walls

a heart that's full up like a landfill
a job that slowly kills you
bruises that won't heal
you look so tired, unhappy

a handshake of carbon monoxide

with no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises

my final bellyache

two jumps in a week
i bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you boy?
flying on your motorcycle
watching all the ground beneath you drop

kill yourself for recognition
kill yourself to never ever stop
you broke another mirror
you're turning into something you are not

don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry

drying up in conversation
you will be the one who cannot talk
all your insides fall to pieces
you just sit there wishing you could still make love

they're the ones who'll hate you
when you think you've got the world all sussed out
they're the once who'll spit at you
you'll be the one screaming out

don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry

oh, it's the best thing that you ever had
the best thing you ever, ever had
it's the best thing that you ever had
the best thing you have had is gone away

wake
from your sleep
the drying of
your tears
today
we escape
we escape

pack
and get dressed
before your father hears us
before
all hell
breaks loose

breathe
keep breathing
don't loose
your nerve
breathe
keep breathing
i can't do this
alone

sing
us a song
a song to keep
us warm
there's
such a chill
such a chill

you can laugh
a spineless laugh
we hope your
rules and wisdom choke you

now
we are one
in everlasting peace

we hope that you choke
that you choke
we hope that you choke
that you choke
we hope
that you choke
that you choke
the breath of the morning
i keep forgetting
the smell of the warm summer air

i live in a town
where you can't smell a thing
you watch your feet
for cracks in the pavement

up above
aliens hover
making home movies
for the folks back home

of all these weird creatures
who lock up their spirits
drill holes in themselves
and live for their secrets

they're all
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight

oh

i wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
late at night when i'm driving
take me on board their beautiful ship
show me the world as i'd love to see it

i'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
they'd think that i'd finally lost it completely
i'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
they'd shut me away
but i'd be alright
alright
i'm alright
alright

i'm just
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
faith, you're driving me away
you do it everyday
you don't mean it but it hurts like hell

my brain says i'm receiving pain
a lack of oxygen from my life support
my iron lung

we're too young to fall asleep
too cynical to speak
we are loosing it, can't you tell?

we scratch our eternal itch
our twentieth century bitch and we are grateful for our
iron lung

suck, suck your teenage thumb
toilet trained and dumb
when the power runs out we'll just hum

this this is our new song
just like the last one
a total waste of time
my iron lung

if you're frightened
you can be frightened
you can be, it's okay 

if you're frightened
you can be frightened
you can be, it's okay
a heart that's full up like a landfill
a job that slowly kills you
bruises that won't heal
you look so tired, unhappy
bring down the government
they don't, they don't speak for us
i'll take a quiet life
a handshake of carbon monoxide

with no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
silent, silent

this is my final fit
my final bellyache

with no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises, please

such a pretty house
and such a pretty garden

no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises, please
i don't want to be crippled and cracked
shoulders and wrists, knees and back
ground to dust and ash
crawling on all fours
when you've got to feel it in your bones
when you've got to feel it in your bones
now i can't climb the stairs
pieces missing everywhere
prozak painkillers
when you've got to feel it in your bones
when you've got to feel it in your bones
i used to fly like peter pan
all the children flew when i touched their hands
you see, you've got to feel it in your bones
you see, you've got to feel it in your bones
ah-ah
please could you stop the noise
i'm trying to get some rest
from all the unborn chicken voices in my head
what's that?
what's that?

when i am king, you will be first against the wall
with your opinion which is of no consequence at all
what's that?
what's that?

ambition makes you look pretty ugly
kicking, squealing gucci little piggy

she lives with a broken man
a cracked polystyrene man
who just crumbles and burns

he used to do surgery
for girls in the eighties
but gravity always wins

and it wears him out
it wears him out
it wears him out
wears him out

she looks like the real thing
she tastes like the real thing
my fake plastic love

but i can't help the feeling
i could blow through the ceiling
if i just turn and run

and it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out

and if i could be who you wanted
if i could be who you wanted
all the time

in an interstellar burst
i am back to save the universe

in a deep, deep sleep
of the innocent
i am born again

in a fast german car
i'm amazed that i survived
an airbag saved my life

in an interstellar burst
i am back to save the universe

in an interstellar burst
i am back to save the universe

in an interstellar burst
i am back to save the universe

faith, you're driving me away
you do it everyday
you don't mean it but it hurts like hell

my brain says i'm receiving pain
a lack of oxygen from my life support
my iron lung

we're too young to fall asleep
too cynical to speak
we are loosing it, can't you tell?

we scratch our eternal itch
our twentieth century bitch and we are grateful for our
iron lung

suck, suck your teenage thumb
toilet trained and dumb
when the power runs out we'll just hum

this this is our new song
just like the last one
a total waste of time
my iron lung

if you're frightened
you can be frightened
you can be, it's okay 

if you're frightened
you can be frightened
you can be, it's okay
you can force it but it will not come
you can taste it but it will not form
you can crush it but it's always here
you can crush it but it's always near
chasing you home

saying, everything is broken
everyone is broken

you can force it but it will stay stung
you can crush it as dry as a bone
you can walk it home straight from school
you can kiss, you can break all the rules

but still, everything is broken
everyone is broken
everyone is, everyone is broken
everyone is, everything is broken

why can't you forget?
why can't you forget?
why can't you forget?
oh, banana co.
we really love you, and we need you
and oh, banana co.
we'd really love to believe you

but everything's underground
we gotta dig it up somehow
yeah, yeah

oh, she said "no go"
she said she'd like to, she's seen you
and oh, banana co.
she knows if you die then we all do

and everything's underground
we've gotta dig it up somehow
yeah, yeah

everything's burning down
we gotta put it out somehow
yeah, yeah
the breath of the morning
i keep forgetting
the smell of the warm summer air

i live in a town
where you can't smell a thing
you watch your feet
for cracks in the pavement

up above
aliens hover
making home movies
for the folks back home

of all these weird creatures
who lock up their spirits
drill holes in themselves
and live for their secrets

they're all
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight

oh

i wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
late at night when i'm driving
take me on board their beautiful ship
show me the world as i'd love to see it

i'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
they'd think that i'd finally lost it completely
i'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
they'd shut me away
but i'd be alright
alright
i'm alright
alright

i'm just
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight

where do we go from here?
the words are coming out all weird
where are you now?
when i need you
alone on an airplane
falling asleep against the windowpane
my blood will thicken

i need to wash myself again
to hide all the dirt and pain
'cause i'd be scared
that there's nothing underneath
and who are my real friends
have they all got the bends?
am i really sinking
this slow

my baby's got the bends
oh, no
we don't have any real friends

just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
and i wish it was the sixties, i wish i could be happy
i wish, i wish, i wish that something would happen

where do we go from here?
the planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
and where are you?

they brought in the c.i.a
the tanks and the whole marines to blow me away
to blow me sky-high

baby's got the bends
we don't have any real friends

just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen

i can feel the hills exploding
exploding gracefully
burning up the freeway
here it comes
grass is green at the edge of the bubble
beautiful gets into beautiful trouble
and it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you.
oh baby burn

fast die younger
burns rubber
useless rockers
from england
good times
had by all
just swallow your guilt and your crutches
blue and white birds stop and hide on the pedal
interstate fire walk staright down the middle,
and it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you

a green plastic watering can
for a fake chinese rubber plant
in the fake plastic earth

that she bought from a rubber man
in a town full of rubber plans
to get rid of itself

it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out

she lives with a broken man
a cracked polystyrene man
who just crumbles and burns

he used to do surgery
for girls in the eighties
but gravity always wins

and it wears him out
it wears him out
it wears him out
wears him out

she looks like the real thing
she tastes like the real thing
my fake plastic love

but i can't help the feeling
i could blow through the ceiling
if i just turn and run

and it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out

and if i could be who you wanted
if i could be who you wanted
all the time
all the time
i don't want to be crippled and cracked
shoulders and wrists, knees and back
ground to dust and ash
crawling on all fours
when you've got to feel it in your bones
when you've got to feel it in your bones
now i can't climb the stairs
pieces missing everywhere
prozak painkillers
when you've got to feel it in your bones
when you've got to feel it in your bones
i used to fly like peter pan
all the children flew when i touched their hands
you see, you've got to feel it in your bones
you see, you've got to feel it in your bones
ah-ah
wake from your sleep
breathe, keep breathing
you can laugh a spineless laugh
we hope that you choke
i'm on a roll
i'm on a roll this time
i feel my luck could change

kill me, sarah
kill me again with love
it's gonna be a glorious day

pull me out of the aircrash
pull me out of the lake
'cause i'm your superhero
we are standing on the edge

the head of state has called for me by name
but i don't have time for him
it's gonna be a glorious day
i feel my luck could change

pull me out of the aircrash
pull me out of the lake
'cause i'm your superhero
we are standing on the edge

we are standing on the edge
i am the key to the lock in your house
that keeps your toys in the basement
and if you get too far inside
you'll only see my reflection

it's always best when the light is off
i am the pick in the ice
do not cry out or hit the alarm
you know we're friends till we die

and either way you turn
i'll be there
open up your skull
i'll be there
climbing up the walls

it's always best when the light is off
it's always better on the outside
fifteen blows to the back of your head
fifteen blows to your mind

so lock the kids up safe tonight
shut the eyes in the cupboard
i've got the smell of a local man
who's got the loneliest feeling

that either way he turns
i'll be there
open up your skull
i'll be there

climbing up the walls
climbing up the walls
climbing up the walls
a heart that's full up like a landfill
a job that slowly kills you
bruises that won't heal
you look so tired, unhappy
bring down the government
they don't, they don't speak for us
i'll take a quiet life
a handshake of carbon monoxide

with no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
silent, silent

this is my final fit
my final bellyache

with no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises, please

such a pretty house
and such a pretty garden

no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises, please
rows of houses, all bearing down on me
i can feel their blue hands touching me
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
and fade out again and fade out

this machine will, will not communicate
these thoughts and the strain i am under
be a world child, form a circle
before we all go under
and fade out again and fade out again

cracked eggs, dead birds
scream as they fight for life
i can feel death, can see its beady eyes
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
fade out again
fade out again

immerse your soul in love
immerse your soul in love
rows of houses, all bearing down on me
i can feel their blue hands touching me
all these things into position

two jumps in a week
i bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you boy?
flying on your motorcycle
watching all the ground beneath you drop

kill yourself for recognition
kill yourself to never ever stop
you broke another mirror
you're turning into something you are not

don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry

drying up in conversation
you will be the one who cannot talk
all your insides fall to pieces
you just sit there wishing you could still make love

they're the ones who'll hate you
when you think you've got the world all sussed out
they're the once who'll spit at you
you'll be the one screaming out

don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry

oh, it's the best thing that you ever had
the best thing you ever, ever had
it's the best thing that you ever had
the best thing you have had is gone away

d-don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry



open your mouth wide
the universal sigh
and while the ocean blooms
it's what keeps me alive

open your mouth wide
the universal sigh
and while the ocean blooms
it's what keeps me alive

ocean blooms
the moon is high up on a mountain
the lunatics have taken over the asylum
waiting on the rapture

singing, "we're here to keep your prices down
we'll feed you to the hounds
to the daily mail, to get up, together"

you made a pig's ear, you made a mistake
paid off security and got through the gate
you got away with it but we lie in wait, eh
eh, eh

where's the truth what's the use
i'm hanging around lost and found
and when you're here innocent
fat chance, no plan
no regard for human life

you'll keep time, you've no right
you're fast to lose, you will lose
you jumped the queue, you're back again

president for life, love of all
the flies in the sky, the beasts of the earth
the fish in the sea have lost command
you are not mine
and i am not yours
and that’s okay
please don’t judge me
turn to nasty now
the dark cell
the pillar of my soul
the last one out of the box
the one who broke this spell

little by little by hook or by crook
i'm such a tease
and you're such a flirt
once you've been hurt
you've been around enough

little by little by hook or by crook
never get earnest
never get judged
i'm no idiot
i should look

your clue on hold, snapped up
crawling with my love
the last one out of the box
the one that broke the seal

obligation
complication
routines and schedules
drug and kill you
kill you

little by little by hook or by crook
never get nervous
never get judged
i'm no idiot
i should look

little by little by hook or by crook
i'm such a tease
and you're such a flirt
slight of hand
jump off the end
into a clear lake
no one around
just dragonflies
fantasize
no one gets hurt

you've done nothing wrong
slide your hand
jump off the end
the water's clear
and innocent
the water's clear
and innocent
it's like i'm fallen out of bed
from a long, weary dream
the sweetest flowers and fruits are hanging from trees
falling off the giant bird that's been carrying me
it's like i've fallen out of bed
from a long and vivid dream
just exactly as i remember
every word
every gesture

and my heart, in my mouth
like i'm fallen out of bed
from a long and vivid dream
finally i'm free of all the weight i've been carrying

and as that woman blows her cover
in the eye of the beholder
i'm a fish now out of water
falling off a giant bird that's been carrying me

i fell open
i laid under
at the tip out
i was just your number
i want stay on it
and get back under

and if you think this is over
then you're wrong
if you think this is over
then you're wrong
if you think this is over
then you're wrong

(wake me up, wake me up)
if you think this is over
then you're wrong
(wake me up, wake me up)
like i'm fallen out of bed
from a long and vivid dream
finally i'm free of all the weight i've been carrying

when at last you'll give in
when at last you'll give in

wake me up
wake me up

wake me up
wake me up

i will shape myself into your pocket
invisible
do what you want
do what you want

i will shrink and i will disappear
i will slip into the groove and cut me off
and cut me off

there's an empty space inside my heart
where the weeds take root
and now i'll set you free
i'll set you free

there's an empty space inside my heart
where the weeds take root
so now i'll set you free

just to see what if

just to fill your fast ballooning head
listen to your heart

we will shrink and we'll be quiet as mice
and while the cat is away

where the weeds take root
so now i'll set you free
i'll set you free

'cause all i want is the moon upon a stick
just to see what if
just to see what is
the bird lights float into my room

slowly we unfurl
as lotus flowers
'cause all i want is the moon upon a stick
i dance around the pit
the darkness is beneath
i can't kick your habit
just to feed your fast ballooning head
listen to your heart
i walk down the staircase, 
magnetic pull.
back to the other place
that i cannot go.
i'm sending a chopper, 
to steal you away.

the pot is full, 
let me take control, 
let me take control.

the pot is full
of secrets to be told, 
secrets to be told.

out of orbit
and i always will.

the pot is full, 
let me take control, 
let me take control.

the pot is full
of secrets to be told, 
secrets to be told

i have jettisoned my illusions
i have dislodged my depressions

i jumped in the river, what did i see?
black-eyed angels swam with me
a moon full of stars and astral cars
and all the figures i used to see

all my lovers were there with me
all my past and futures
and we all went to heaven in a little row boat
there was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt

the drying of
your tears
today
we escape
we escape

pack
and get dressed
before your father hears us
before
all hell
breaks loose

breathe
keep breathing
don't loose
your nerve
breathe
keep breathing
i can't do this
alone

sing
us a song
a song to keep
us warm
there's
such a chill
such a chill

you can laugh
a spineless laugh
we hope your
rules and wisdom choke you

now
we are one
in everlasting peace

we hope that you choke
that you choke
we hope that you choke
that you choke
we hope
that you choke
that you choke
the breath of the morning
i keep forgetting
the smell of the warm summer air

i live in a town
where you can't smell a thing
you watch your feet
for cracks in the pavement

up above
aliens hover
making home movies
for the folks back home

of all these weird creatures
who lock up their spirits
drill holes in themselves
and live for their secrets

they're all
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight

oh

i wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
late at night when i'm driving
take me on board their beautiful ship
show me the world as i'd love to see it

i'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
they'd think that i'd finally lost it completely
i'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
they'd shut me away
but i'd be alright
alright
i'm alright
alright

i'm just
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
faith, you're driving me away
you do it everyday
you don't mean it but it hurts like hell

my brain says i'm receiving pain
a lack of oxygen from my life support
my iron lung

we're too young to fall asleep
too cynical to speak
we are loosing it, can't you tell?

we scratch our eternal itch
our twentieth century bitch and we are grateful for our
iron lung

suck, suck your teenage thumb
toilet trained and dumb
when the power runs out we'll just hum

this this is our new song
just like the last one
a total waste of time
my iron lung

if you're frightened
you can be frightened
you can be, it's okay 

if you're frightened
you can be frightened
you can be, it's okay
i'm on a roll
i'm on a roll this time
i feel my luck could change

kill me, sarah
kill me again with love
it's gonna be a glorious day

pull me out of the aircrash
pull me out of the lake
'cause i'm your superhero
we are standing on the edge

the head of state has called for me by name
but i don't have time for him
it's gonna be a glorious day
i feel my luck could change

pull me out of the aircrash
pull me out of the lake
'cause i'm your superhero
we are standing on the edge

we are standing on the edge
you can force it but it will not come
you can taste it but it will not form
you can crush it but it's always here
you can crush it but it's always near
chasing you home

saying, everything is broken
everyone is broken

you can force it but it will stay stung
you can crush it as dry as a bone
you can walk it home straight from school
you can kiss, you can break all the rules

but still, everything is broken
everyone is broken
everyone is, everyone is broken
everyone is, everything is broken

why can't you forget?
why can't you forget?
why can't you forget?
a heart that's full up like a landfill
a job that slowly kills you
bruises that won't heal
you look so tired, unhappy
bring down the government
they don't, they don't speak for us
i'll take a quiet life
a handshake of carbon monoxide

with no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
silent, silent

this is my final fit
my final bellyache

with no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises, please

such a pretty house
and such a pretty garden

no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises, please
i don't want to be crippled and cracked
shoulders and wrists, knees and back
ground to dust and ash
crawling on all fours
when you've got to feel it in your bones
when you've got to feel it in your bones
now i can't climb the stairs
pieces missing everywhere
prozak painkillers
when you've got to feel it in your bones
when you've got to feel it in your bones
i used to fly like peter pan
all the children flew when i touched their hands
you see, you've got to feel it in your bones
you see, you've got to feel it in your bones
ah-ah
please could you stop the noise
i'm trying to get some rest
from all the unborn chicken voices in my head
what's that?
what's that?

when i am king, you will be first against the wall
with your opinion which is of no consequence at all
what's that?
what's that?

ambition makes you look pretty ugly
kicking, squealing gucci little piggy
you don't remember
you don't remember
why don't you remember my name?
off with his head, man
off with his head, man
why don't you remember my name?
i guess he does

rain down, rain down

from a great height
from a great height, height

from a great height
from a great height
rain down, rain down (that's it, sir, you're leaving, the crackle of pigskin)
come on rain down on me (the dust and the screaming, the yuppies networking)
from a great height (the panic, the vomit, the panic, the vomit)
god loves his childrean
god loves his children, yeah
a green plastic watering can
for a fake chinese rubber plant
in the fake plastic earth

that she bought from a rubber man
in a town full of rubber plans
to get rid of itself

it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out

she lives with a broken man
a cracked polystyrene man
who just crumbles and burns

he used to do surgery
for girls in the eighties
but gravity always wins

and it wears him out
it wears him out
it wears him out
wears him out

she looks like the real thing
she tastes like the real thing
my fake plastic love

but i can't help the feeling
i could blow through the ceiling
if i just turn and run

and it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out

and if i could be who you wanted
if i could be who you wanted
all the time
all the time
transport, motorways and tramlines
starting and then stopping
taking off and landing
the emptiest of feelings
disappointed people, clinging on to bottles
when it comes it's so, so, disappointing

let down and hanging around
crushed like a bug in the ground
let down and hanging around

shell smashed, juices flowing
wings twitch, legs are going
don't get sentimental, it always ends up drivel
one day, i am gonna grow wings
a chemical reaction
hysterical and useless
hysterical and

let down and hanging around
crushed like a bug in the ground
let down and hanging around

let down
let down
let down

you know, you know where you are with
you know where you are with
floor collapsing, falling
bouncing back and one day, i am gonna grow wings
a chemical reaction (you know where you are)
hysterical and useless (you know where you are)
hysterical and (you know where you are)

let down and hanging around
crushed like a bug in the ground
let down and hanging around
rows of houses, all bearing down on me
i can feel their blue hands touching me
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
and fade out again and fade out

this machine will, will not communicate
these thoughts and the strain i am under
be a world child, form a circle
before we all go under
and fade out again and fade out again

cracked eggs, dead birds
scream as they fight for life
i can feel death, can see its beady eyes
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
fade out again
fade out again

immerse your soul in love
immerse your soul in love
i am the key to the lock in your house
that keeps your toys in the basement
and if you get too far inside
you'll only see my reflection

it's always best when the light is off
i am the pick in the ice
do not cry out or hit the alarm
you know we're friends till we die

and either way you turn
i'll be there
open up your skull
i'll be there
climbing up the walls

it's always best when the light is off
it's always better on the outside
fifteen blows to the back of your head
fifteen blows to your mind

so lock the kids up safe tonight
shut the eyes in the cupboard
i've got the smell of a local man
who's got the loneliest feeling

that either way he turns
i'll be there
open up your skull
i'll be there

climbing up the walls
climbing up the walls
climbing up the walls
just as you take my hand
just as you write my number down
just as the drinks arrive
just as they play your favorite song
as the magic disappears
no longer wound up like a spring
before you've had too much
come back and focus again

the walls abandon shape
you've got a cheshire cat grin
all blurring into one
this place is on a mission
before the night owl
before the animal noises
closed circuit cameras
before you're comatose

before you run away from me
before you're lost between the noise
the beat goes round and round
the beat goes round and round
i never really got there
i just pretended that i had
what's the point of instruments
words are a sawed off shotgun

come on and let it out
come on and let it out
come on and let it out
come on and let it out

before you run away from me
before you start unraveling
before you take my mic
just as you dance, dance, dance

jigsaws falling into place
there is nothing to explain
you eye each other as you pass
she looks back, you look back
not just once
not just twice
wish away the nightmare
wish away the nightmare
you've got a light you can feel it on your back
you've got a light you can feel it on your back
jigsaws falling into place
come on, come on
you think you drive me crazy
come on, come on
you and whose army?
you and your cronies
come on, come on
holy roman empire
come on if you think
come on if you think
you can take us on
you can take us on

you and whose army?
you and your cronies

you forget so easily
we ride tonight
we ride tonight
ghost horses
ghost horses
we ride tonight
we ride tonight
ghost horses
ghost horses
ghost horses
it's funny how
to drive your stupid car
it's funny how
'cause i never get that far

and you put my brain in overload
i can't change gear
i cannot see the road

you got concrete eyes
and i cannot see your face
and i failed in life
'cause you crushed me with your hands

and you put my brain in overload
i can't change gears
i cannot see the road
i never wanted anything like this 
i worked hard, tried hard 
i ran around in domestic bliss 
i fought hard, died long 
every time you're running out of here 
every time you're running i get the fear 

i never wanted any broken bones 
scarred face, no home 
your words surround me and asphyxiate 
and i burn all hate 

every time you're running out on me 
every time you're running i can see 

i'm not a vegetable 
i will not control myself 
i spit on the hand that feeds me 
i will not control myself 

the waters spray, the waters run all over me 
the waters spray, the waters run 
and this time you gonna pay 

i'm not a vegetable 
i will not control myself 
i spit on the hand that feeds me 
i will not control myself
i can't afford to breathe in this town 
nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand 
look back up to the cathode ray 
i'm better off dead 
i'm better off dead 
i'm better off

prove yourself 
prove yourself 
prove yourself 

i want to breathe, i want to grow 
i'd say i want it but i don't know how 
i work, i bleed, i beg, i pray 

and i'm better off dead 
i'm better off dead 
i'm better off

prove yourself 
prove yourself 
prove yourself 

i'm better off dead 
i'm better off dead 
i'm better off

prove yourself
prove yourself 
prove yourself 
prove yourself (whoa)
prove yourself
prove yourself 
prove yourself
when you were here before
couldn't look you in the eye
you're just like an angel
your skin makes me cry
you float like a feather
in a beautiful world
i wish i was special
you're so fuckin' special

but i'm a creep

i don't belong here

please forget the words that i just blurted out 
it wasn't me, it was a strange and creeping doubt 
it keeps rattling my cage 
there's nothing in this world will keep it down 

even though i might, even though i try
i can't 

even though i might, even though i try
i can't 

so many things that keep, keep me underground 
so many words that i, that i can never find 

if you give up on me now
i'll be gutted like i've never been before 

even though i might, even though i try
i can't

even though i might, even though i try
i can't

if you give up on me now
i'll be gutted like i've never been before

even though i might, even though i try
i can't

even though i might, even though i try
i can't

even though i might, even though i try
i can't

even though i might, even though i try
i can't

your eyes are on my wall, your teeth are over there
but i'm still no one, and you're not a star
what do you care?

been thinking about you, and there's no rest
shit, i still love you, still see you in bed
but i'm playing with myself
what do you care when the other men are far, far better?

all the things you got
all the things you need
who bought you cigarettes
who bribed the company to come and see you, honey

i've been thinking about you, so how can you sleep?
these people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet
they don't know what i know
why should you care, when i'm not there?

been thinking about you, and there's no rest

i am fused just in case i blow out
i am glued just because i crack out

everything i touch turns to stone 
everything i touch

good night, everybody, thank you
the mongrel cat came home
holding half a head
proceeded to show it off
to all his new found friends
he said "i been where i liked
i slept with who i liked
she ate me up for breakfast
and screwed me in a vice

and now i don't know why
i feel so tongue-tied"

i sat in the cupboard
and wrote it down in neat
they were cheering and waving
cheering and waving
twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis
but it got edited fucked up
strangled, beaten up
used as a photo in time magazine
buried in a burning black hole in devon

"i don't know why
i feel so tongue-tied

don't know why
i feel so skinned alive."

my thoughts are misguided and a little naive
i twitch and i salivate like with myxomatosis
you should put me in a home or you should put me down
i got myxomatosis
i got myxomatosis

"now no one likes a smart arse but we all like stars"
that wasn't my intention, i did it for a reason
it must have got mixed up
strangled, beaten up
i got myxomatosis
i got myxomatosis

"i don't know why
i feel so tongue-tied"
in pitch dark
i go walking in your landscape
broken branches
trip me as i speak

just 'cause you feel it
doesn't mean it's there
just 'cause you feel it
doesn't mean it's there

there's always a siren
singing you to shipwreck
(don't reach out, don't reach out)
(don't reach out, don't reach out)
steer away from these rocks
we'd be a walking disaster
(don't reach out, don't reach out)

we are accidents waiting
waiting to happen

we are accidents waiting
waiting to happen
once again i'm in trouble with my only friend
she is papering the window panes
she is putting on a smile
living in a glass house

once again packed like frozen food and battery hens
think of all the starving millions
don't talk politics and don't throw stones
your royal highness's

well of course i'd like to sit around and chat
well of course i'd like to stay and chew the fat
well of course i'd like to sit around and chat

why don't you quiet down? 
(maybe i want to live in the children's land and you know maybe, maybe i)
why don't you quiet down? 
(maybe i'll wander the promised land i want peace and honesty)
why don't you quiet down? 
(i want to live in the promised land and maybe wander the children's land)

all over the planet's dead
all over the planet, so let me out of here
all over the, all over the, all over the, all over the

a delicate balance

and this just feels like spinning plates
i'm living in cloud cuckoo land
and this just feels like spinning plates
my body is floating down the muddy river
once again i'm in trouble with my only friend

black-eyed angels swam with me
a moon full of stars and astral cars
and all the figures i used to see

all my lovers were there with me
all my past and futures
and we all went to heaven in a little row boat
there was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt

rows of houses, all bearing down on me
i can feel their blue hands touching me
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
and fade out again and fade out

this machine will, will not communicate
these thoughts and the strain i am under
be a world child, form a circle
before we all go under
and fade out again and fade out again

cracked eggs, dead birds
scream as they fight for life
i can feel death, can see its beady eyes
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
fade out again
fade out again

a heart that's full up like a landfill
a job that slowly kills you
bruises that won't heal
you look so tired, unhappy
bring down the government
they don't, they don't speak for us
i'll take a quiet life
a handshake of carbon monoxide

and no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
silent, silent

this is my final fit
my final bellyache

with no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises, please

such a pretty house
and such a pretty garden

no alarms and no surprises (get me out of here)
no alarms and no surprises (get me out of here)
no alarms and no surprises, please (get me out of here)
a green plastic watering can
for a fake chinese rubber plant
in the fake plastic earth
that she bought from a rubber man
in a town full of rubber plans
to get rid of itself

it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out

she lives with a broken man
a cracked polystyrene man
who just crumbles and burns
he used to do surgery
for girls in the eighties
but gravity always wins

and it wears him out
it wears him out
it wears him out
it wears

she looks like the real thing
she tastes like the real thing
my fake plastic love
but i can't help the feeling
i could blow through the ceiling
if i just turn and run

and it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out

and if i could be who you wanted
if i could be who you wanted
all the time
all the time
oh
rows of houses, all bearing down on me
i can feel their blue hands touching me
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
and fade out again and fade out

this machine will, will not communicate
these thoughts and the strain i am under
be a world child, form a circle

immerse your soul in love
immerse your soul in love
i must get out once in a while
everything is starting to die
the dust settles, the worms dig
spiders crawl over the bed

i must get out once in a while
i eat all day and now i'm fat
yesterday's meal is hugging the plate
you never wash up after yourself
i don't want to be crippled and cracked
shoulders and wrists, knees and back
ground to dust and ash
crawling on all fours
when you've got to feel it in your bones
when you've got to feel it in your bones
now i can't climb the stairs
pieces missing everywhere
prozak painkillers
when you've got to feel it in your bones
when you've got to feel it in your bones
i used to fly like peter pan
all the children flew when i touched their hands
you see, you've got to feel it in your bones
you see, you've got to feel it in your bones
ah-ah
here it comes, here it comes,
i can feel the hills exploding
exploding gracefully
burning up the freeway
here it comes
grass is green at the edge of the bubble
beautiful gets into beautiful trouble
and it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you.
oh baby burn

fast die younger
burns rubber
useless rockers
from england
good times
had by all
just swallow your guilt and your crutches
blue and white birds stop and hide on the pedal
interstate fire walk starlight down the middle,
and it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you
oh baby burn
can't get the stink off
he's been hanging around for days
comes like a comet
suckered you but not your friends

one day he'll get to you
and teach you how to be a holy cow

you do it to yourself, you do
and that's what really hurts
is you do it to yourself, just you
you and no-one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself

don't get my sympathy, hanging out the fifteenth floor
you've changed the locks three times
he still comes reeling through the door
one day i'll get to you
and teach you how to get to purest hell

you do it to yourself you do
and that's what really hurts
is you do it to yourself, just you
you and no-one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself

you do it to yourself you do
and that's what really hurts
is you do it to yourself just you
you and no-one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself, whoa

say, hey

you do it to yourself, you do it to yourself
yeah, yeah, you do it to yourself, yes-yes, you
do it to yourself
transport, motorways and tramlines
starting and then stopping
taking off and landing
the emptiest of feelings
disappointed people, clinging on to bottles
when it comes it's so, so, disappointing

let down and hanging around
crushed like a bug in the ground
let down and hanging around

shell smashed, juices flowing
wings twitch, legs are going
don't get sentimental, it always ends up drivel
one day, i am gonna grow wings
a chemical reaction
hysterical and useless
hysterical and

let down and hanging around
crushed like a bug in the ground
let down and hanging around

let down
let down
let down

you know, you know where you are with
you know where you are with
floor collapsing, falling
bouncing back and one day, i am gonna grow wings
a chemical reaction (you know where you are)
hysterical and useless (you know where you are)
hysterical and (you know where you are)

let down and hanging around
crushed like a bug in the ground
let down and hanging around
come on, come on
you think you drive me crazy

holy roman empire

please could you stop the noise
i'm trying to get some rest
from all the unborn chicken voices in my head
what's that?
what's that?

when i am king, you will be first against the wall
with your opinion which is of no consequence at all
what's that?
what's that?

ambition makes you look pretty ugly
kicking, squealing gucci little piggy

you don't remember

why don't you remember my name?
off with his head, man

come on rain down on me (the dust and the screaming, the yuppies networking)
from a great height (the panic, the vomit, the panic, the vomit)
god loves his children
god loves his children, yeah
so, so you think you can tell heaven from hell
blue skies from pain
can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
a smile from a veil?
do you think you can tell?

and did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
hot ashes for trees?
hot air for a cool breeze?
cold comfort for change?
and did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?
how i wish, how i wish you were here
we're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl
year after year running over the same old ground
what have you found?
the same old fears

wish you were here
you got some nerve coming here
you got some nerve coming here
you stole it all
give it back
you stole it all
give it back

good morning, mister magpie
how are we today?
now you've stolen all the magic
i turn my back, walk away

you know you should
but you don't
you know you should
but you don't

good morning, mister magpie
how are we today?
now you've stolen all the magic
took my melody
stay in the shadows
cheer at the gallows
this is a round up

this is a low flying panic attack
sing a song on the jukebox that goes

burn the witch
burn the witch
we know where you live

red crosses on wooden doors
and if you float you burn
loose talk around tables
abandon all reason
avoid all eye contact
do not react
shoot the messengers

this is a low flying panic attack
sing the song of sixpence that goes

burn the witch
burn the witch
we know where you live
we know where you live
dreamers
they never learn
they never learn
beyond the point
of no return
of no return

and it's too late
the damage is done
the damage is done

this goes
beyond me
beyond you

the white room
by a window
where the sun comes
through

and we are
just happy to serve
just happy to serve
you
then in your life, there comes the darkness
there's a spacecraft blocking out the sky
and there's nowhere to hide
you run to the back and you cover your ears
but it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
and are we trapped? rag-doll, cloth people
we are helpless to resist
into our darkest hour

but it was just a laugh, just a laugh
just a laugh, just a laugh
even at this angle
and so we crumble
a ten ton head, made of wet sand
this dread circumference
you gotta be kidding me
the grass grows over me
your face in the glass, in the glass
it was just a laugh, just a laugh
it's whatever you say it is
split infinity

then into your life, there comes a darkness
and a spacecraft blocking out the sky
and there's nowhere to hide
you run to the back and you cover your ears
but it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
into your darkest hour

when you've had enough of me
when you've had enough of me
sweet darling

when you've had enough of me
when you've had enough of me
sweet darling
sweet darling

from a long and vivid dream
just exactly as i remember
every word
every gesture

and my heart, in my mouth
like i'm fallen out of bed
from a long and vivid dream
finally i'm free of all the weight i've been carrying

and as that woman blows her cover
in the eye of the beholder
i'm a fish now out of water
falling off a giant bird that's been carrying me

if you think this is over
then you're wrong
(wake me up, wake me up)
like i'm fallen out of bed
from a long and vivid dream
finally i'm free of all the weight i've been carrying

when at last you'll give in
when at last you'll give in

wake me up
wake me up
wake me up
wake me up
wake me up
wake me up
wake me up
wake me up
i find it hard
to drive your stupid car
i find it hard
cause i never get that far
and you put my brain in overload
and i can't change gears
i cannot see the road
you got concrete eyes
and i cannot see your face
and i failed in life
cause you crushed me with your hands
and you put my brain in overload
i can't change gears
i cannot see the road

why us?
why not someone else, why us?
the cameras are turning off
the lights have run away

and this just feels like spinning plates
our bodies floating down the muddy river

while you make pretty speeches
i'm being cut to shreds
you feed me to the lions
a delicate balance

when this just feels like spinning plates
i'm living in cloud cuckoo land
when this just feels like spinning plates
our bodies floating down the muddy river
when you were here before
couldn't look you in the eye
you're just like an angel
your skin makes me cry
you float like a feather
in a beautiful world
i wish i was special
you're so very special

but i'm a creep
i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doing here?
i don't belong here

i don't care if it hurts
i wanna have control
i want a perfect body
i want a perfect soul
i want you to notice
when i'm not around
you're so very special
i wish i was special

but i'm a creep
i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doing here?
i don't belong here, oh, oh

she's running out the door
she's running out
she run, run, run, run
run

whatever makes you happy
whatever you want
you're so very special
i wish i was special

but i'm a creep
i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doing here?
i don't belong here
i don't belong here
i want to see you smile again
like diamonds in the dust
the amazing sound of the killing hordes
the day the banks collapse on us

cease this endless chattering
like everything is fine
when sorry is not good enough
sit in the back while no-one drives

so glad, so glad you're mine
so glad, so glad you're mine
so glad, so glad you're mine
so glad, so glad you're mine
i was born for your magazines
for your magazines
i am trapped in the society page
of your magazines
of your magazines
i don't know what it means

do you see light at the end of the tunnel?
at the end of the tunnel?
(these are things that get on my nerves)
do you see light at the end of the tunnel?
at the end of the tunnel?
at the end of the tunnel?
(you better start naming names)

there's a little child
running 'round this house
and he never leaves
he will never leave
and the fog comes up from the sewers
and glows in the dark

baby alligators in the sewers grow up fast
grow up fast
anything you want it can be done
how, how did you go bad?
did you go bad?
did you go bad?
some things will never wash away
did you go bad?
did you go bad?
super collider

dust in a moment
particles scatter
coming up from the soup

swimming upstream
before the heavens crack open
thin pixellation
coming up...
go
tears of joy disjointed
this is joy
we'll scare ourselves
now scare ourselves
will scare ourselves
of all that you wanna be
just go paid and now yo...
i'm stuck in the tardis 
trapped in hyperspace 
one minute snake charming
the next in another place

all the right moves and 
in the right place...
don't hurt me
don't hurt me
don't hurt me

i will shape myself into your pocket
invisible
do what you want
do what you want

i will shrink and i will disappear
i will slip into the groove and cut me off
and cut me off

there's an empty space inside my heart
where the weeds take root
and now i'll set you free
i'll set you free

there's an empty space inside my heart
where the weeds take root
so now i'll set you free
i'll set you free

slowly we unfurl
as lotus flowers
'cause all i want is the moon upon a stick
just to see what if
just to see what is
i can't kick your habit
just to fill your fast ballooning head
listen to your heart

we will shrink and we'll be quiet as mice
and while the cat is away
do what we want
do what we want

there's an empty space inside my heart
where the weeds take root
so now i'll set you free
i'll set you free

'cause all i want is the moon upon a stick
just to see what if
just to see what is
the bird lights float into my room

slowly we unfurl
as lotus flowers
'cause all i want is the moon upon a stick
i dance around the pit
the darkness is beneath
i can't kick your habit
just to feed your fast ballooning head
listen to your heart
i will
lay me down
in a bunker
underground

i won't let this happen
to my children
meet the real-world coming
out of your shell

with white elephants
sitting ducks
i will
rise up

little baby's eyes
eyes, eyes, eyes
little baby's eyes
eyes, eyes, eyes

little baby's eyes

i will stop
i will stop at nothing

i trust i can rely on your vote

when i go forwards, you go backwards
and somewhere we will meet
when i go forwards, you go backwards

you can force it but it will not come
you can taste it but it will not form
you can crush it but it's always here
you can crush it but it's always near
chasing you home

saying, everything is broken
everyone is broken

you can force it but it will stay stung
you can crush it as dry as a bone
you can walk it home straight from school
you can kiss, you can break all the rules

but still, everything is broken
everyone is broken
everyone is, everyone is broken
everyone is, everything is broken

why can't you forget?
why can't you forget?
why can't you forget?
in pitch dark
i go walking in your landscape
broken branches
trip me as i speak

just 'cause you feel it
doesn't mean it's there
just 'cause you feel it
doesn't mean it's there

there's always a siren
singing you to shipwreck
(don't reach out, don't reach out)
(don't reach out, don't reach out)
steer away from these rocks
we'd be a walking disaster
(don't reach out, don't reach out)
(don't reach out, don't reach out)

just 'cause you feel it
doesn't mean it's there
(someone on your shoulder)
(someone on your shoulder)
just 'cause you feel it

there there

why so green and lonely?
and lonely, and lonely?

heaven sent you to me
to me, to me?

we are accidents waiting
waiting to happen

we are accidents waiting
waiting to happen
a heart that's full up like a landfill
a job that slowly kills you
bruises that won't heal
you look so tired, unhappy
bring down the government
they don't, they don't speak for us
i'll take a quiet life
a handshake of carbon monoxide

and no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
silent, silent

this is my final fit
my final bellyache

with no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises, please

such a pretty house
and such a pretty garden

no alarms and no surprises (get me out of here)
no alarms and no surprises (get me out of here)

he's bitter and twisted, he knows what he wants 
he wants to be loved and he wants to belong 
he wants you to listen, he wants us to weep 
and he was a stupid baby who turned into a powerful freak

but how do you?
how do you? 
how do you? 

he lives with his mother, but we show him respect
he's a dangerous bigot, but we always forget
and he's just like his daddy, 'cause he cheats on his friends
and he steals and he bullies, any way that he can

when i am king, you will be first against the wall
with your opinion which is of no consequence at all
what's that?

i don't want to be crippled and cracked
shoulders and wrists, knees and back
ground to dust and ash
crawling on all fours
when you've got to feel it in your bones
when you've got to feel it in your bones
now i can't climb the stairs
pieces missing everywhere
prozak painkillers
when you've got to feel it in your bones
when you've got to feel it in your bones
i used to fly like peter pan
all the children flew when i touched their hands
you see, you've got to feel it in your bones

ah-ah
i sail to the moon
i spoke too soon
and how much did it cost
i was dropped from
moonbeam
and sailed on shooting stars

maybe you'll
be president

you'll build an ark

and sail us to the moon

i must get out once in a while
everything is starting to die
the dust settles, the worms dig
spiders crawl over the bed

i must get out once in a while
i eat all day and now i'm fat
yesterday's meal is hugging the plate
you never wash up after yourself
oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh

where do we go from here?
the words are coming out all weird
where are you now?
when i need you
alone on an airplane
falling asleep against the windowpane
my blood will thicken

i need to wash myself again
to hide all the dirt and pain
'cause i'd be scared
that there's nothing underneath
and who are my real friends
have they all got the bends?
am i really sinking
this slow

my baby's got the bends
oh, no
we don't have any real friends
no, no, no

just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
and i wish it was the sixties, i wish i could be happy
i wish, i wish, i wish that something would happen

where do we go from here?
the planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
and where are you?

they brought in the c.i.a
the tanks and the whole marines to blow me away
to blow me sky-high

baby's got the bends
we don't have any real friends

just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
i wish it was the sixties, i wish i could be happy
i wish, i wish, i wish that something would-

i want to live, breathe
i want to be part of the human race
i want to live, breathe
i want to be part of the human race, race, race?

where do we go from here?
the words are coming out all weird, where are you now?
when i need you
i'll drown my beliefs
to have your babies
i'll dress like your niece
and wash your swollen feet

just don't leave
don't leave

i'm not living
i'm just killing time
your tiny hands
your crazy kitten smile

just don't leave
don't leave

and true love waits
in haunted attics
and true love lives
on lollipops and crisps

just don't leave
don't leave
something for the rag and bone man
over my dead body
something big is gonna happen
over my dead body

someone's son or someone's daughter
over my dead body
this is how i end up sucked in
over my dead body

i'm gonna go to sleep
let this wash all over me

we don't really want a monster taking over
tiptoe around, tie him down
we don't want the loonies taking over
tiptoe around, tie them down

may pretty horses
come to you
as you sleep
i'm gonna go to sleep
and let this wash all over me
i might be wrong
i might be wrong
i could have sworn i saw a light coming on

i used to think
i used to think
there was no future left at all
i used to think

open up, begin again
let's go down the waterfall
think about the good times and never look back
never look back

what would i do?
what would i do?
if i did not have you?

open up and let me in
let's go down the waterfall
have ourselves a good time
it's nothing at all
nothing at all
nothing at all

keep it moving
keep it moving
ah, ah
ah
rows of houses, all bearing down on me
i can feel their blue hands touching me
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
and fade out again and fade out

this machine will, will not communicate
these thoughts and the strain i am under
be a world child, form a circle
before we all go under
and fade out again and fade out again

cracked eggs, dead birds
scream as they fight for life
i can feel death, can see its beady eyes
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
fade out again
fade out again

immerse your soul in love
immerse your soul in love
i jumped in the river, what did i see?
black-eyed angels swam with me
a moon full of stars and astral cars
and all the figures i used to see

all my lovers were there with me
all my past and futures
and we all went to heaven in a little row boat
there was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt

over my dead body

while you make pretty speeches
i'm being cut to shreds
you feed me to the lions
a delicate balance

and this just feels like spinning plates
i'm living in cloud cuckoo land
and this just feels like spinning plates
my body is floating down the muddy river

here it comes, here it comes,
i can feel the hills exploding
exploding gracefully
burning up the freeway
here it comes
grass is green at the edge of the bubble
beautiful gets into beautiful trouble
and it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you.
oh baby burn

fast die younger
burns rubber
useless rockers
from england
good times
had by all
just swallow your guilt and your crutches
blue and white birds stop and hide on the pedal
interstate fire walk starlight down the middle,
and it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you
oh baby burn

your eyes are on my wall, your teeth are over there
but i'm still no one, and you're now a star
what do you care?
been thinking about you, and there's no rest
should i still love you, still see you in bed
but i'm playing with myself
what do you care when the other men are far, far better?

all the things you got
all the things you need
who bought you cigarettes
who bribed the company to come and see you, honey

yesterday's headlines blown by the wind.
yesterday's people end up scatterbrain.
any fool can easy pick a hole. (i only wish i could fall in)

a moving target in a firin' range.

and you're such a flirt
once you've been hurt
you've been around enough

little by little by hook or by crook

never get judged

your clue on hold, snapped up
crawling with my love
the last one out of the box
the one that broke the seal

when i need you
alone on an airplane
falling asleep against the windowpane
my blood will thicken

i need to wash myself again
to hide all the dirt and pain
'cause i'd be scared
that there's nothing underneath
and who are my real friends
have they all got the bends?
am i really sinking
this slow

my baby's got the bends
oh, no
we don't have any real friends
no, no, no

just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
and i wish it was the sixties, i wish i could be happy
i wish, i wish, i wish that something would happen

where do we go from here?
the planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
and where are you?

they brought in the c.i.a
the tanks and the whole marines to blow me away
to blow me sky-high

baby's got the bends
we don't have any real friends

just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
i wish it was the sixties, i wish i could be happy
i wish, i wish, i wish that something would-

i want to live, breathe
i want to be part of the human race
i want to live, breathe
i want to be part of the human race, race, race?

where do we go from here?
the words are coming out all weird, where are you now?
when i need you
in pitch dark
i go walking in your landscape
broken branches
trip me as i speak

just 'cause you feel it
doesn't mean it's there
just 'cause you feel it
doesn't mean it's there

there's always a siren
singing you to shipwreck
(don't reach out, don't reach out)
(don't reach out, don't reach out)
steer away from these rocks
we'd be a walking disaster
(don't reach out, don't reach out)
(don't reach out, don't reach out)

just 'cause you feel it
doesn't mean it's there
(someone on your shoulder)
(someone on your shoulder)
just 'cause you feel it
doesn't mean it's there
(someone on your shoulder)
(someone on your shoulder)
there there

why so green and lonely?
and lonely, and lonely?

heaven sent you to me
to me, to me?

we are accidents waiting
waiting to happen

we are accidents waiting
waiting to happen
in the deepest ocean
the bottom of the sea
your eyes
they turn me
why should i stay here?
why should i stay?

i'd be crazy not to follow
follow where you lead
your eyes
they turn me

turn me on to phantoms
i follow to the edge of the earth
and fall off
yeah, everybody leaves
if they get the chance
and this is my chance

i get eaten by the worms
and weird fishes
picked over by the worms
and weird fishes
weird fishes
weird fishes

i'll hit the bottom
hit the bottom and escape
escape

i'll hit the bottom
hit the bottom and escape
escape
you can force it but it will not come
you can taste it but it will not form
you can crush it but it's always here
you can crush it but it's always near
chasing you home

saying, everything is broken
everyone is broken

you can force it but it will stay stung
you can crush it as dry as a bone
you can walk it home straight from school
you can kiss, you can break all the rules

but still, everything is broken
everyone is broken
everyone is, everyone is broken
everyone is, everything is broken

why can't you forget?
why can't you forget?
why can't you forget?
now as i go upon my way
so let me go upon my way
born of a light
born of a light

the wind rushing round my open heart
an open ravine
in my spirit white
totally alive
in my spirit light

through an open doorway
across a street
to another life
and catching my reflection in a window
switching on a light
one i didn't know
totally alive
totally released

waking, waking up from shutdown
from a thousand years of sleep
yeah you, you know what i mean
you know what i mean
you know what i mean

standing on the edge of you
you know what i mean
you know what i mean
you know what i mean

two jumps and a week
i bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you boy
flying on your motorcycle
watching all the ground beneath you drop

kill yourself for recognition
kill yourself to never ever stop
you broke another mirror
you're turning into something you are not

don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
don't leave me high, don't leave me dry

drying up in conversation 
you will be the one who cannot talk
all your insides fall to pieces
you just sit there wishing you could still make love

they're the ones who'll hate you 
when you think you've got the world all sussed out
they're the once who'll spit at you
you'll be the one screaming out

don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
don't leave me high, don't leave me dry

it's the best thing that you ever had, 
the best thing you ever, ever had
it's the best thing that you ever had, 
the best thing you have had is gone away

don't leave me high, don't leave me dry 
don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
don't leave me high, 
don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
don't get any big ideas
they're not gonna happen

you paint yourself white
and fill up with noise
there'll be something missing

now that you've found it
it's gone
now you feel it, you don't
you've gone off the rails

so don't get any big ideas
they're not gonna happen
you'll go to hell
for what your
dirty mind is thinking
i do not
understand
what it is
i've done wrong
full of holes
check for pulse
blink your eyes
one for yes
two for no

i have no idea what i am talking about
i'm trapped in this body and can't get out
oh, oh
oh, oh

you killed the sound
removed backbone
pale imitation
with the edges all
sawn off

i have no idea what you are talking about
your mouth moves only with someone's hand up your arse
oh, oh

has the light gone out for you?
because the light's gone for me
it is the 21st century
it is the 21st century
it can follow you like a dog
it brought me to my knees
they got a skin and they put me in
they got a skin and they put me in
all the lines wrapped around my face
all the lines wrapped around my face
and for anyone else to see
and for anyone else to see

i'm alive

i've seen it coming
i've seen it coming
i've seen it coming
i've seen it coming
i don't want to be your friend
i just want to be your lover
no matter how it ends
no matter how it starts

forget about your house of cards
and i'll do mine
forget about your house of cards
and i'll do mine

fall off the table
get swept under
denial, denial

the infrastructure will collapse
voltage spikes
throw your keys in the bowl
kiss your husband goodnight

forget about your house of cards
and i'll do mine
forget about your house of cards
and i'll do mine

fall off the table
and get swept under

it's gonna be a glorious day

pull me out of the aircrash
pull me out of the lake
'cause i'm your superhero
we are standing on the edge

the head of state has called for me by name
but i don't have time for him
it's gonna be a glorious day
i feel my luck could change

pull me out of the aircrash
pull me out of the lake
'cause i'm your superhero
we are standing on the edge

we are standing on the edge
the breath of the morning
i keep forgetting
the smell of the warm summer air

i live in a town
where you can't smell a thing
you watch your feet
for cracks in the pavement

up above
aliens hover
making home movies
for the folks back home

of all these weird creatures
who lock up their spirits
drill holes in themselves
and live for their secrets

they're all
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight

oh

i wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
late at night when i'm driving
take me on board their beautiful ship
show me the world as i'd love to see it

i'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
they'd think that i'd finally lost it completely
i'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
they'd shut me away
but i'd be alright
alright
i'm alright
alright

i'm just
uptight
uptight
uptight
uptight

a green plastic watering can
for a fake chinese rubber plant
in the fake plastic earth

that she bought from a rubber man
in a town full of rubber plans
to get rid of itself

it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out

she lives with a broken man
a cracked polystyrene man
who just crumbles and burns

he used to do surgery
for girls in the eighties
but gravity always wins

and it wears him out
it wears him out
it wears him out
wears him out

she looks like the real thing
she tastes like the real thing
my fake plastic love

but i can't help the feeling
i could blow through the ceiling
if i just turn and run

and it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out

and if i could be who you wanted
if i could be who you wanted
all the time
all the time
rows of houses, all bearing down on me
i can feel their blue hands touching me
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
and fade out again and fade out

this machine will, will not communicate
these thoughts and the strain i am under
be a world child, form a circle
before we all go under
and fade out again and fade out again

cracked eggs, dead birds
scream as they fight for life
i can feel death, can see its beady eyes
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
fade out again
fade out again

immerse your soul in love
immerse your soul in love
limb by limb and tooth by tooth
tearing up inside of me
every day every hour
i wish that i was bullet proof

wax me
mould me
heat the pins and stab them in
you have turned me into this
just wish that it was bullet proof

so pay the money and take a shot
leadfill the hole in me
i could burst a million bubbles
all surrogate and bullet proof

and bullet proof
and bullet proof
and bullet proof
